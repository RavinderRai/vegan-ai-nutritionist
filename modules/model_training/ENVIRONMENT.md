# Activating Poetry Environment

Main storage ran out of memory, so created a virtual env with poetry in an external drive. To activate it, open WSL2, navigate to the model_training folder where the pyproject.toml file is, and then run this:

`source /mnt/d/poetry_envs/model-training-2TO7YsnT-py3.10/bin/activate`
