Estimation of nutrients and heavy metals.Concentrations of nutrients (Ca, Na, P, Mg, K) and heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) in carrot juice were estimated by digesting of nitric acid (HNO Plants have evolved miRNA-target modules to regulate the tolerance to nutrient stress, some of which are evolutionarily related to environmental adaptation. A single miRNA may target more than one transcript, and vice versa, to fine-tune the expression of genes, which converges into a sophisticated and extremely fault-tolerant crosstalk. Accumulating findings highlight that miRNAs furnish a bridge for the transportation and stockpile of N and Pi nutrition in the plants, plant-environment interactions, and plant-plant communications through the modulation of N and Pi signaling transduction.The main themes that emerged from previous studies are the role of miRNAs in enhancing NUE and PUE of plants, as well as the adaptive responses of plants to N and Pi stresses. Destructive effects of nutrient stress on plants are largely dependent on the inheritance and variation of plants and the influence of the environment due to the immobility of plants and the complexity of the environment. One area of future research that needs to be addressed in more detail concerns the function of miRNAs in the communications between plants and the environment. For example, the role of plant symbionts in exporting sRNA to induce transboundary gene silencing to improve N and Pi homeostasis of plants has not been well reported and requires further investigation. In addition, future studies on miRNA*s as underappreciated regulatory components would also expand our understanding of The research directions mainly focus on the upstream regulatory mechanisms and the downstream regulatory roles of miRNAs responding to nutrient stress. In particular, the upstream regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs are still in their infancy, such as the mechanisms by which miRNAs are loaded for precise regulation. For instance, in Arabidopsis, Pi starvation significantly increases the expression of miR778, miR827, and miR2111, and inhibits the expression of miR168, miR395, and miR398. Interestingly, the expression of miR778 and miR2111 quickly decrease by approximately two folds within three hours of the restored Pi supply (Paul et al.

The induction of flowering requires controlled light regimes, which complicates agricultural practices [Inducing flowering in tissue culture systems holds promise as a tool to address both issues: reliably producing cannabinoids in a highly controlled environment and enhancing breeding programs by allowing numerous crosses to be conducted in a small facility. In addition, tissue culture systems offer precise control over factors such as plant growth regulators, light intensity, photoperiod, and temperature, making it a valuable tool for studying the elements affecting flower initiation and floral organ development [Plant tissue culture involves cultivating plant cells, tissues, or organs on defined nutrient media under aseptic conditions and controlled environments, occasionally supplemented with growth\u00a0regulators to induce specific cellular responses [There are numerous reports on in vitro flowering across diverse plant species, with applications ranging from studying floral mechanisms to potential uses as a breeding tool for trait assessment and speeding up developmental timelines [In this study, we developed an effective protocol for inducing flowering in cannabis in vitro.

Samples were then centrifuged at max speed for 5\u00a0min, then the supernatant was transferred to a clean 2\u00a0ml tube. The samples were then dried down completely in a rotovap. The samples were analyzed using a slight modification of the method of Yazdani et al.To achieve this separation, a gradient elution technique was employed. This technique uses a two-part mobile phase system, consisting of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and methanol (MeOH). The gradual change in the ratio of these components over time helps to separate the various compounds within the sample. The chromatography column was initially equilibrated with 1% MeOH. To separate the analytes, a non-linear, concave gradient was applied. This gradient gradually increased the MeOH concentration to 20% over 7.5\u00a0min. The mobile phase composition was then held constant for an additional 4.5\u00a0min. Finally, the column was re-equilibrated back to its starting conditions with 1% MeOH over 3\u00a0min.A Waters photodiode array (PDA) detector was used to monitor the presence of carotenoids by measuring their absorbance across a wavelength range of 250\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm. To quantify each specific carotenoid, we optimized a unique detection wavelength that balanced sensitivity (high signal) and selectivity (minimal interference from other compounds).

Statistical tests comparing the performance of plants in the two media without activated charcoal showed that plants in the DKW medium exhibited higher flower production than those in the MS medium at three-time points (Fig.\u00a0In tissue culture systems, sugar serves two primary roles: as an energy source [Besides sucrose, hormones can also play a role in increasing the number of flowers.

Since there are no significant differences between 2 and 3% sucrose, and 2% is more economical and potentially reduces contamination, we will continue using 2% sucrose. Plants in tissue cultures are grown under controlled conditions that differ significantly from the natural environment. These optimized conditions enhance growth but can also induce stress due to the lack of fluctuations throughout the day and the lack of natural cues, leading to altered physiological responses. However, this platform allows us to fine-tune factors such as nutrient composition, light intensity, and temperature, thereby enhancing growth and development.In this study, we focused on determining the optimal conditions for the in vitro flowering of cannabis. This approach holds immense potential for the sterile production of secondary metabolites free from pathogens like Using our protocol, we cultivated five plants per vessel and arranged the cultures on a shelf measuring 45 cm in width and 1 m in length, accommodating a total of 32 vessels in a 4 by 8 configuration (Fig. S6). This setup allowed for the growth of 160 plants per shelf. By stacking four shelves vertically in a standard growth room, we demonstrated the capacity to grow a total of 640 plants on a 1-m length floor area, highlighting the substantial potential of this method.However, it is important to note this approach's limitations, including the potentially lower yield of synthesized cannabinoids compared to traditional cultivation and the possible need for genotype-specific media development [When we introduced the stem segments to tissue culture, the flowering time and the number of flowers produced were comparable, regardless of whether the plants were immediately subjected to a flowering-promoting photoperiod or first experienced a vegetative phase. We propose that since the day length cue is perceived in leaves to initiate the cascade that activates the flowering machinery [In Our results, showing normal stomata development in tissue culture and high chlorophyll content with improved growth in filtered vessels with and without a carbon source, suggest that cannabis shoots can perform photosynthesis in tissue culture. However, the moderate plant growth in a sugar-free medium indicates that the plant cannot be fully autotrophic under our growth conditions with passive ventilation, likely due to limited CO\u2082. This is supported by the CO\u2082 level measured within a filtered vessel containing plants, showing values between 150 and 250 mmol/mol during the photoperiod, depending on the number of filters, while the CO\u2082 concentration in the room was maintained at 350\u2013400 mmol/mol [In tissue culture, sucrose in the media provides the necessary carbon for energy and growth, with standard concentrations generally ranging from 2 to 3% (w/v). As we did not observe a significant difference between these concentrations, we selected the 2% for our protocol, which offers several potential advantages. Low sucrose levels can enhance photosynthetic activity, partly by stimulating Rubisco activity, which often leads to increased plant vigor [Light intensity can promote mixotrophic growth, which relies on both sucrose in the media and photosynthesis. Our results, however, show that increasing the light intensity during the flowering-promoting photoperiod led to significantly fewer flowers. The appearance of yellow leaves when high-intensity light is applied (Fig. S7) suggests that the plants might be experiencing light-induced stress.In outdoor plants, prolonged exposure to excessive light can lead to photoinhibition, reducing photosynthetic capacity and causing chlorophyll degradation. The light intensity applied in tissue culture is considerably lower than that of outdoor environments[Plants in tissue culture are placed in a closed box without buffer elements like wind, shading, and light fluctuations throughout the day. This may intensify the effects of high light and might cause increased temperature and humidity. Additionally, tissue cultures often consist of young tissues in early growth stages, making them more susceptible to environmental stresses due to the lack of protective structures like a thick cuticle or well-developed cell walls [It might be that the lack of a phyllosphere microbiome due to sterile conditions in tissue cultures reduces plant fitness and increases susceptibility to light-induced stress. Microorganisms can produce protective compounds, such as pigments and antioxidants [In our experiment, when low light intensity was applied during the 12/12 h cycle, the plants produced more flowers regardless of the intensity during the vegetative phase. We propose that during the initial period under the flowering induction regime, the plants have time to recover before the transition to inflorescence meristem. During this phase, the newly developing leaves grow under low light and become robust, supporting future inflorescence meristem and flower development.Seed production in vitro remains relatively unexplored, with only a few studies reported. In orchids, tomatoes, and wheat, in vitro flowering is proposed to accelerate breeding programs by shortening the life cycle [In cannabis, the individual female and male flowers that developed in vitro exhibited phenotypes similar to those of growth room flowers. However, the anthers did not burst and release pollen. Typically, anthers open under low relative humidity (RH), whereas high RH can delay or prevent this process [The average number of female flowers produced was six, with an average of 4.4 seeds developing per inflorescence/plant. Low pollen grain viability might have led to incomplete fertilization, preventing some flowers from producing seeds. Another possibility is that the plant's small size could not support extensive seed development. Out of the collected seeds, only an average of 2.4 seeds per plant germinated (Table S1). However, achieving one successful succession per generation is sufficient for a breeding program aimed at hybrid seed production and generating numerous homozygous plants to test various combinations.", "response": "Plant-based diets can have a positive impact on mood and emotional well-being in individuals with mental health concerns.

A single miRNA may target more than one transcript, and vice versa, to fine-tune the expression of genes, which converges into a sophisticated and extremely fault-tolerant crosstalk. Accumulating findings highlight that miRNAs furnish a bridge for the transportation and stockpile of N and Pi nutrition in the plants, plant-environment interactions, and plant-plant communications through the modulation of N and Pi signaling transduction.The main themes that emerged from previous studies are the role of miRNAs in enhancing NUE and PUE of plants, as well as the adaptive responses of plants to N and Pi stresses. Destructive effects of nutrient stress on plants are largely dependent on the inheritance and variation of plants and the influence of the environment due to the immobility of plants and the complexity of the environment. One area of future research that needs to be addressed in more detail concerns the function of miRNAs in the communications between plants and the environment.

In particular, the upstream regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs are still in their infancy, such as the mechanisms by which miRNAs are loaded for precise regulation. For instance, in Arabidopsis, Pi starvation significantly increases the expression of miR778, miR827, and miR2111, and inhibits the expression of miR168, miR395, and miR398.

The tubes were then shaken for 30\u00a0s, incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, then shaken again. Samples were then centrifuged at max speed for 5\u00a0min, then the supernatant was transferred to a clean 2\u00a0ml tube. The samples were then dried down completely in a rotovap. The samples were analyzed using a slight modification of the method of Yazdani et al.To achieve this separation, a gradient elution technique was employed. This technique uses a two-part mobile phase system, consisting of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and methanol (MeOH). The gradual change in the ratio of these components over time helps to separate the various compounds within the sample. The chromatography column was initially equilibrated with 1% MeOH. To separate the analytes, a non-linear, concave gradient was applied. This gradient gradually increased the MeOH concentration to 20% over 7.5\u00a0min. The mobile phase composition was then held constant for an additional 4.5\u00a0min. Finally, the column was re-equilibrated back to its starting conditions with 1% MeOH over 3\u00a0min.A Waters photodiode array (PDA) detector was used to monitor the presence of carotenoids by measuring their absorbance across a wavelength range of 250\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm. To quantify each specific carotenoid, we optimized a unique detection wavelength that balanced sensitivity (high signal) and selectivity (minimal interference from other compounds). Beta-carotene served as the calibration standard. Concentrations of all other carotenoids were then expressed as equivalents of beta-carotene using TargetLynx software within MassLynx 4.1 (Waters software).

Foliar tissue was sampled from random leaves sampled towards the apical meristem on each plant and the composite sample was then immediately frozen, ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until extraction. Fruit tissue was gathered from 1\u20132 mature green (MG), breaker (BR), and red ripe (RR) fruits from each plant. Upon harvesting, we recorded the weight (g) of each fruit for our analysis of average fruit weight and left the fruit on the lab bench overnight to allow wound ethylene to subside.

Among the edible plant taxa with very tasty flowers are basils: they are sweet due to the presence of drops of nectar, while the aromatic notes vary depending on the cultivars and hybrids. One of the most famous, Many basil cultivars are cultivated to harvest the leaves, which are used to make the \u201cpesto\u201d sauce ('Genovese' or 'Italiko') (Laura et al. Basil\u2019s aroma is determined by several volatile aromatic compounds released by flowers and leaves: the composition, concentration, and ratios of these aromatic compounds influence the sensory features. The secondary compounds (such as terpenes and phenylpropanoids) that constitute essential oils (EOs) are synthesized and stored in the glandular trichomes (mainly capitate and peltate trichomes) present on the epidermis of basil leaves and flowers (Gang et al. The presence of specific secondary compounds was found to be indicative of a particular taste: for example, the presence of linalool imparts a sweet/floral taste; eucalyptol is responsible for the fresh/eucalyptus-like aroma; eugenol tastes like clove; methyl chavicol resembles the anise aroma; methyl cinnamate is responsible for the cinnamon flavour; citral, neral, and geranial are linked to a citrus aroma (Brechbill While data on the distribution and types of trichomes responsible for the production of essential oils in basil leaves are available in the literature (Werker The recent increased consumption of edible flowers has led to a more complex production chain and the delivery of packaged commercial compositions (Marchioni et al.

A total of 23 morphotypes, including non-glandular and glandular hairs and distinguishable by the shape, number of cells in the stalk/head and the size, was found by screening the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the calyx and the adaxial surface of the petals, similarly to what performed by Dos Santos Tozin and Rodrigues (Many of the trichome types recognized have been already reported in Lamiaceae. Different types of capitate elements have been recorded in the family, including trichomes with stalks of different length (Werker et al.

Among the edible plant taxa with very tasty flowers are basils: they are sweet due to the presence of drops of nectar, while the aromatic notes vary depending on the cultivars and hybrids. One of the most famous, Many basil cultivars are cultivated to harvest the leaves, which are used to make the \u201cpesto\u201d sauce ('Genovese' or 'Italiko') (Laura et al. Basil\u2019s aroma is determined by several volatile aromatic compounds released by flowers and leaves: the composition, concentration, and ratios of these aromatic compounds influence the sensory features. The secondary compounds (such as terpenes and phenylpropanoids) that constitute essential oils (EOs) are synthesized and stored in the glandular trichomes (mainly capitate and peltate trichomes) present on the epidermis of basil leaves and flowers (Gang et al. The presence of specific secondary compounds was found to be indicative of a particular taste: for example, the presence of linalool imparts a sweet/floral taste; eucalyptol is responsible for the fresh/eucalyptus-like aroma; eugenol tastes like clove; methyl chavicol resembles the anise aroma; methyl cinnamate is responsible for the cinnamon flavour; citral, neral, and geranial are linked to a citrus aroma (Brechbill While data on the distribution and types of trichomes responsible for the production of essential oils in basil leaves are available in the literature (Werker The recent increased consumption of edible flowers has led to a more complex production chain and the delivery of packaged commercial compositions (Marchioni et al. Among the tools used for taxa identification, the DNA barcoding approach is gaining more and more importance as a reliable molecular method, and it is now widely used as a tool to disentangle the provenance of food products (Galimberti et al.

However, similar morphological characteristics may contaminate edible flowers with those of poisonous relatives (Matyjaszczyk and \u015amiechowska Although Through DNA barcoding analysis, as shown in Table\u00a0Although the cultivar level was not reachable through molecular tools, micromorphological and histochemical differences supporting the discrimination of the specimens were found, and the sites of production of secondary metabolites with known bioactive properties and nutritional value such as polyphenols, lipids/terpenoids and polysaccharides were characterised.Previously, Marchioni et al.

A total of 23 morphotypes, including non-glandular and glandular hairs and distinguishable by the shape, number of cells in the stalk/head and the size, was found by screening the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the calyx and the adaxial surface of the petals, similarly to what performed by Dos Santos Tozin and Rodrigues (Many of the trichome types recognized have been already reported in Lamiaceae. Different types of capitate elements have been recorded in the family, including trichomes with stalks of different length (Werker et al.

After obtaining bacterial and fungal OTU tables in QIIME, the bacterial dataset was rarefied to 10,724 reads per sample and the fungal dataset was rarefied to 37 reads per sample, which were the lowest number of reads for a sample in each dataset. We then calculated Bray\u2013Curtis distances between samples, which were utilized to perform a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and create an ordination to visualize differences in bacterial and fungal community composition between inoculant treatments. We then quantitatively assessed the effect of inoculant treatment on community composition with PERMANOVA using the adonis2 function. Due to a lack of adequate post hoc tests with adonis2, we could not perform pairwise comparisons of community composition between inoculant treatments following our analysis and only assessed the main effect of inoculant treatment on bacterial and fungal community composition. PERMANOVA requires homogeneity of variance, which we analyzed using the betadisper function. Shannon diversity indexes were then calculated for each sample and we compared the average Shannon diversity of the inoculant treatments using a linear model and the anova function to extract test statistics. We then used the emmeans function to perform pairwise comparisons of Shannon diversity between treatment groups. Model assumptions were verified using plotting methods.

These optimized conditions enhance growth but can also induce stress due to the lack of fluctuations throughout the day and the lack of natural cues, leading to altered physiological responses. However, this platform allows us to fine-tune factors such as nutrient composition, light intensity, and temperature, thereby enhancing growth and development.In this study, we focused on determining the optimal conditions for the in vitro flowering of cannabis. This approach holds immense potential for the sterile production of secondary metabolites free from pathogens like Using our protocol, we cultivated five plants per vessel and arranged the cultures on a shelf measuring 45 cm in width and 1 m in length, accommodating a total of 32 vessels in a 4 by 8 configuration (Fig. S6). This setup allowed for the growth of 160 plants per shelf. By stacking four shelves vertically in a standard growth room, we demonstrated the capacity to grow a total of 640 plants on a 1-m length floor area, highlighting the substantial potential of this method.However, it is important to note this approach's limitations, including the potentially lower yield of synthesized cannabinoids compared to traditional cultivation and the possible need for genotype-specific media development [When we introduced the stem segments to tissue culture, the flowering time and the number of flowers produced were comparable, regardless of whether the plants were immediately subjected to a flowering-promoting photoperiod or first experienced a vegetative phase. We propose that since the day length cue is perceived in leaves to initiate the cascade that activates the flowering machinery [In Our results, showing normal stomata development in tissue culture and high chlorophyll content with improved growth in filtered vessels with and without a carbon source, suggest that cannabis shoots can perform photosynthesis in tissue culture. However, the moderate plant growth in a sugar-free medium indicates that the plant cannot be fully autotrophic under our growth conditions with passive ventilation, likely due to limited CO\u2082. This is supported by the CO\u2082 level measured within a filtered vessel containing plants, showing values between 150 and 250 mmol/mol during the photoperiod, depending on the number of filters, while the CO\u2082 concentration in the room was maintained at 350\u2013400 mmol/mol [In tissue culture, sucrose in the media provides the necessary carbon for energy and growth, with standard concentrations generally ranging from 2 to 3% (w/v). As we did not observe a significant difference between these concentrations, we selected the 2% for our protocol, which offers several potential advantages. Low sucrose levels can enhance photosynthetic activity, partly by stimulating Rubisco activity, which often leads to increased plant vigor [Light intensity can promote mixotrophic growth, which relies on both sucrose in the media and photosynthesis. Our results, however, show that increasing the light intensity during the flowering-promoting photoperiod led to significantly fewer flowers. The appearance of yellow leaves when high-intensity light is applied (Fig. S7) suggests that the plants might be experiencing light-induced stress.In outdoor plants, prolonged exposure to excessive light can lead to photoinhibition, reducing photosynthetic capacity and causing chlorophyll degradation. The light intensity applied in tissue culture is considerably lower than that of outdoor environments[Plants in tissue culture are placed in a closed box without buffer elements like wind, shading, and light fluctuations throughout the day. This may intensify the effects of high light and might cause increased temperature and humidity. Additionally, tissue cultures often consist of young tissues in early growth stages, making them more susceptible to environmental stresses due to the lack of protective structures like a thick cuticle or well-developed cell walls [It might be that the lack of a phyllosphere microbiome due to sterile conditions in tissue cultures reduces plant fitness and increases susceptibility to light-induced stress. Microorganisms can produce protective compounds, such as pigments and antioxidants [In our experiment, when low light intensity was applied during the 12/12 h cycle, the plants produced more flowers regardless of the intensity during the vegetative phase. We propose that during the initial period under the flowering induction regime, the plants have time to recover before the transition to inflorescence meristem. During this phase, the newly developing leaves grow under low light and become robust, supporting future inflorescence meristem and flower development.Seed production in vitro remains relatively unexplored, with only a few studies reported. In orchids, tomatoes, and wheat, in vitro flowering is proposed to accelerate breeding programs by shortening the life cycle [In cannabis, the individual female and male flowers that developed in vitro exhibited phenotypes similar to those of growth room flowers. However, the anthers did not burst and release pollen. Typically, anthers open under low relative humidity (RH), whereas high RH can delay or prevent this process [The average number of female flowers produced was six, with an average of 4.4 seeds developing per inflorescence/plant. Low pollen grain viability might have led to incomplete fertilization, preventing some flowers from producing seeds. Another possibility is that the plant's small size could not support extensive seed development. Out of the collected seeds, only an average of 2.4 seeds per plant germinated (Table S1). However, achieving one successful succession per generation is sufficient for a breeding program aimed at hybrid seed production and generating numerous homozygous plants to test various combinations. Hydroponic experiments were conducted in an artificial climate room at Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China (36\u00b07\u2032 N, 118\u00b02\u2032 E), in 2021. Two sweet potato cultivars, Jishu 26 (J26, N-sensitive) and Xushu 32 (X32, N-tolerant)Seedlings were collected at 10\u00a0days after culture. The shoots and roots were divided, and the fresh weight (FW) was measured. In each replicate of each treatment, four seedlings were randomly collected and divided into leaves, petioles, stems, growth points (the part above the third expanded leaf from the shoot apex) and roots for dry matter and N content analysis. Another four seedlings were collected, and their third expanded leaves and roots were frozen in liquid N and stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C for physiological index and gene expression analyses. The remaining seedlings were used for the flux measurements of NORoot growth was evaluated by image analysis. The roots were floated on waterproof trays and scanned using a specialized EPSON V750 scanner (Seiko Epson Corp., Suwa, Nagano, Japan) at a resolution of 300 dpi. WinRHIZO Pro software (Regent Instruments Inc., Quebec, Canada) was utilized to analyse root images, which provided the total root length, root surface area, average root diameter and root volumeThe plant samples divided into different organs were oven-dried to a constant weight at 70\u00a0\u00b0C to measure their biomass. The total N content was determined with a Kjeldahl apparatus (Kjeltec 8100, FOSS, Hoganas, Sweden)Leaves and root samples of 0.1\u00a0g were added to 1\u00a0mL of distilled water in a centrifuge tube and boiled for 30\u00a0min to extract the nitrate. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009NR and NiR activities were determined in accordance with the method described by Sun et al.The NOTotal RNA was extracted using a total RNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biotech Co. Ltd. China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed following the manufacturer's protocol (Takara Bio Inc. Japan). The expression levels of the target genes were determined by qRT\u2013PCR using SYBR green fluorescent dye on a Bio\u2013Rad CFX96 thermocycler (Bio\u2013Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The specific primers for the qRT-PCR assay were referred to Ren et al.Two-way ANOVA (cultivars and NO The experimental design is outlined in Fig.\u00a0Outline of plant inoculation and cultivation in the greenhouse with the vermicompost (V), sterile vermicompost (SV), and no-compost (C) control inoculants. In the growth chamber stage of our experiment (3\u00a0weeks), tomato seedlings were cultivated in magenta boxes filled with sterilized potting soil. Each seedling was first assigned to one of the three treatment groups. The seedlings then received the inoculant corresponding to their group and were cultivated in the growth chamber. After three weeks, the seedlings were then transferred to 6-inch pots and cultivated in a seedling greenhouse for one week to acclimate to a greenhouse environment. The seedlings were then transferred to a standard greenhouse for the remainder of the experiment, which lasted 13\u00a0weeks.Tomato plants (Ailsa Craig) were derived from the tomato germplasm collection at the United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Facility (USDA-ARS) Robert W. Holley Center for Agriculture and Health (Ithaca, NY, USA) and they were grown in a plant growth facility at Boyce Thompson Institute (Ithaca, NY, USA). We filled 15 magenta boxes with sterilized potting soil (50% metromix 360, 50% cornell mix\u2009+\u2009osmocote) to grow our seedlings. Each magenta box was randomly assigned to one of the three inoculant treatments, comprised of five replicate plants per treatment in this experiment. Before planting, each box received 20\u00a0ml of a solution made of 16\u00a0ml of one of the microbial inoculant treatments and 4\u00a0ml of 500\u00a0ppm Peter\u2019s excel fertilizer (15\u20135\u201315 NPK). The solution was then mixed into the soil to keep the medium moist and to evenly distribute the fertilizer and inoculant solution. We then planted one pre-germinated Ailsa Craig seed into each magenta box and watered each seedling with 10\u00a0ml of sterile water.After planting, the magenta boxes were placed in a growth chamber set at 250\u00a0\u00b5mol of light, 10% humidity, alternating between 28\u00a0\u00b0C for 16\u00a0h and 23\u00a0\u00b0C for 8\u00a0h for three weeks. Seedlings were then hardened off in the growth chamber, transplanted into 6-inch pots filled with the same sterilized potting soil, then placed in a seedling greenhouse to be hardened off before the rest of the experiment. The seedling greenhouse had day temperatures between 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 27\u00a0\u00b0C, night temperatures between 18\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u00a0\u00b0C, and natural light and humidity. The seedlings were hand watered every day with tap water during this phase. Soils were covered with sterilized aluminum foil to reduce outside microbial contamination. After one week, tomatoes were transplanted into one-gallon pots filled with sterilized potting soil and placed in a new greenhouse with day temperatures between 24\u00a0\u00b0C and 26\u00a0\u00b0C, night temperatures between 21\u00a0\u00b0C and 23\u00a0\u00b0C, and natural light and humidity. The plants were kept in this greenhouse for the remainder of the experiment, which lasted 13\u00a0weeks. Plants were watered daily with tap water and fertilized with 150\u00a0ppm N Peter\u2019s excel fertilizer three times a week. Sterilized aluminum foil was placed over the soil to reduce microbial contamination from the air. Aboveground plant biomass and rhizosphere soil samples were harvested three months after transplanting. Rhizosphere soil was collected by gently breaking up the tomato root ball, holding the roots, and gently shaking away unattached soil. The soil adhering to the roots was considered rhizosphere soil, which was sampled and stored at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C for DNA extractions. Upon harvesting, plants were placed in a drying oven set at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for one week and total aboveground dry biomass (g) was then recorded.DNA was extracted from rhizosphere soil samples collected at harvest using a PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturers protocol. Approximately 200\u2013250\u00a0mg of frozen rhizosphere soil from each pot was used for each extraction. We then amplified the 16S rRNA and ITS gene sequences to capture bacterial and fungal taxonomic data using the PCR and sequencing procedures outlined in Bray et al.To process our bacterial and fungal sequences, we used a modified version of the pipeline from the Brazilian Microbiome Project (Dried foliar tissue from each plant was used for analysis of foliar tissue nitrogen content at the Cornell Stable Isotope Laboratory (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA) using a Thermo Delta V isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) interfaced to an NC2500 elemental analyzer. The analysis provided information on \u03b4To analyze the effect of inoculant treatment on fruit ethylene production, we harvested one fruit at the breaker stage from each plant during the trial and analyzed ethylene production based on modified procedures outlined in Nguyen et al.To analyze how fruit carotenoid content may change in response to the rhizosphere microbiome, we harvested one mature green, breaker, and red ripe fruit from each plant and performed carotenoid extractions. After being harvested and remaining on the lab bench overnight, fruits were cut, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to a fine powder. We then aliquoted\u2009~\u2009100\u00a0mg of frozen ground tissue into 2\u00a0ml tubes with glass beads and lyophilized the samples. Each tube then received 50\u00a0\u03bcl of magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) at a 0.003\u00a0M concentration followed by 500\u00a0\u03bcl of 100% ethyl acetate. The tubes were then shaken for 30\u00a0s, incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, then shaken again. Samples were then centrifuged at max speed for 5\u00a0min, then the supernatant was transferred to a clean 2\u00a0ml tube. The samples were then dried down completely in a rotovap. The samples were analyzed using a slight modification of the method of Yazdani et al.To achieve this separation, a gradient elution technique was employed. This technique uses a two-part mobile phase system, consisting of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and methanol (MeOH). The gradual change in the ratio of these components over time helps to separate the various compounds within the sample. The chromatography column was initially equilibrated with 1% MeOH. To separate the analytes, a non-linear, concave gradient was applied. This gradient gradually increased the MeOH concentration to 20% over 7.5\u00a0min. The mobile phase composition was then held constant for an additional 4.5\u00a0min. Finally, the column was re-equilibrated back to its starting conditions with 1% MeOH over 3\u00a0min.A Waters photodiode array (PDA) detector was used to monitor the presence of carotenoids by measuring their absorbance across a wavelength range of 250\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm. To quantify each specific carotenoid, we optimized a unique detection wavelength that balanced sensitivity (high signal) and selectivity (minimal interference from other compounds). Beta-carotene served as the calibration standard. Concentrations of all other carotenoids were then expressed as equivalents of beta-carotene using TargetLynx software within MassLynx 4.1 (Waters software).In order to assess the effect of the rhizosphere microbiome on plant gene expression and regulatory pathways, we performed RNA extractions on tomato foliar and fruit tissue. We gathered foliar tissue from plants at four weeks old (Young) and at harvest (Mature). Foliar tissue was sampled from random leaves sampled towards the apical meristem on each plant and the composite sample was then immediately frozen, ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until extraction. Fruit tissue was gathered from 1\u20132 mature green (MG), breaker (BR), and red ripe (RR) fruits from each plant. Upon harvesting, we recorded the weight (g) of each fruit for our analysis of average fruit weight and left the fruit on the lab bench overnight to allow wound ethylene to subside. Fruits were then cut, frozen, and ground in liquid nitrogen. Powdered fruit samples were then stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until extraction.RNA was extracted from foliar and fruit tissue using modified reagents and procedures from the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA in each sample was then quantified using a nanodrop and ran on a 1% agarose gel to verify the RNA quantity and quality of each extract. Total RNA from foliar and fruit tissue was then used to construct strand-specific RNA libraries as described in Zhong et al.Raw RNA-Seq reads were processed to remove adaptors and low-quality sequences using Trimmomatic (version 0.36) with default parametersTo gain insight into the influence of the microbiome on host developmental processes and regulatory pathways, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis using the upregulated and downregulated genes reported in Related File 1. For each pairwise comparison between inoculant treatments across the foliar and fruit developmental stages, upregulated and downregulated gene lists were uploaded to agriGO v2.0All statistical analyses of the rhizosphere microbiome and plant phenotype data were performed in R. After obtaining bacterial and fungal OTU tables in QIIME, the bacterial dataset was rarefied to 10,724 reads per sample", "response": "As a gardener interested in sustainable practices and plant-based diets, focus on growing a diverse range of plant-based foods year-round in your garden.

The induction of flowering requires controlled light regimes, which complicates agricultural practices [Inducing flowering in tissue culture systems holds promise as a tool to address both issues: reliably producing cannabinoids in a highly controlled environment and enhancing breeding programs by allowing numerous crosses to be conducted in a small facility. In addition, tissue culture systems offer precise control over factors such as plant growth regulators, light intensity, photoperiod, and temperature, making it a valuable tool for studying the elements affecting flower initiation and floral organ development [Plant tissue culture involves cultivating plant cells, tissues, or organs on defined nutrient media under aseptic conditions and controlled environments, occasionally supplemented with growth\u00a0regulators to induce specific cellular responses [There are numerous reports on in vitro flowering across diverse plant species, with applications ranging from studying floral mechanisms to potential uses as a breeding tool for trait assessment and speeding up developmental timelines [In this study, we developed an effective protocol for inducing flowering in cannabis in vitro. We optimized the media and growing conditions and demonstrated the ability to produce viable seeds. Therefore, this method can serve as a rapid and straightforward approach to breeding programs, a potential method for producing cannabinoids, and a valuable tool for studying the flowering aspects of cannabis. Plants in tissue cultures are grown under controlled conditions that differ significantly from the natural environment. These optimized conditions enhance growth but can also induce stress due to the lack of fluctuations throughout the day and the lack of natural cues, leading to altered physiological responses. However, this platform allows us to fine-tune factors such as nutrient composition, light intensity, and temperature, thereby enhancing growth and development.In this study, we focused on determining the optimal conditions for the in vitro flowering of cannabis. This approach holds immense potential for the sterile production of secondary metabolites free from pathogens like Using our protocol, we cultivated five plants per vessel and arranged the cultures on a shelf measuring 45 cm in width and 1 m in length, accommodating a total of 32 vessels in a 4 by 8 configuration (Fig. S6). This setup allowed for the growth of 160 plants per shelf. By stacking four shelves vertically in a standard growth room, we demonstrated the capacity to grow a total of 640 plants on a 1-m length floor area, highlighting the substantial potential of this method.However, it is important to note this approach's limitations, including the potentially lower yield of synthesized cannabinoids compared to traditional cultivation and the possible need for genotype-specific media development [When we introduced the stem segments to tissue culture, the flowering time and the number of flowers produced were comparable, regardless of whether the plants were immediately subjected to a flowering-promoting photoperiod or first experienced a vegetative phase. We propose that since the day length cue is perceived in leaves to initiate the cascade that activates the flowering machinery [In Our results, showing normal stomata development in tissue culture and high chlorophyll content with improved growth in filtered vessels with and without a carbon source, suggest that cannabis shoots can perform photosynthesis in tissue culture. However, the moderate plant growth in a sugar-free medium indicates that the plant cannot be fully autotrophic under our growth conditions with passive ventilation, likely due to limited CO\u2082. This is supported by the CO\u2082 level measured within a filtered vessel containing plants, showing values between 150 and 250 mmol/mol during the photoperiod, depending on the number of filters, while the CO\u2082 concentration in the room was maintained at 350\u2013400 mmol/mol [In tissue culture, sucrose in the media provides the necessary carbon for energy and growth, with standard concentrations generally ranging from 2 to 3% (w/v). As we did not observe a significant difference between these concentrations, we selected the 2% for our protocol, which offers several potential advantages. Low sucrose levels can enhance photosynthetic activity, partly by stimulating Rubisco activity, which often leads to increased plant vigor [Light intensity can promote mixotrophic growth, which relies on both sucrose in the media and photosynthesis. Our results, however, show that increasing the light intensity during the flowering-promoting photoperiod led to significantly fewer flowers. The appearance of yellow leaves when high-intensity light is applied (Fig. S7) suggests that the plants might be experiencing light-induced stress.In outdoor plants, prolonged exposure to excessive light can lead to photoinhibition, reducing photosynthetic capacity and causing chlorophyll degradation. The light intensity applied in tissue culture is considerably lower than that of outdoor environments[Plants in tissue culture are placed in a closed box without buffer elements like wind, shading, and light fluctuations throughout the day. This may intensify the effects of high light and might cause increased temperature and humidity. Additionally, tissue cultures often consist of young tissues in early growth stages, making them more susceptible to environmental stresses due to the lack of protective structures like a thick cuticle or well-developed cell walls [It might be that the lack of a phyllosphere microbiome due to sterile conditions in tissue cultures reduces plant fitness and increases susceptibility to light-induced stress. Microorganisms can produce protective compounds, such as pigments and antioxidants [In our experiment, when low light intensity was applied during the 12/12 h cycle, the plants produced more flowers regardless of the intensity during the vegetative phase. We propose that during the initial period under the flowering induction regime, the plants have time to recover before the transition to inflorescence meristem. During this phase, the newly developing leaves grow under low light and become robust, supporting future inflorescence meristem and flower development.Seed production in vitro remains relatively unexplored, with only a few studies reported. In orchids, tomatoes, and wheat, in vitro flowering is proposed to accelerate breeding programs by shortening the life cycle [In cannabis, the individual female and male flowers that developed in vitro exhibited phenotypes similar to those of growth room flowers. However, the anthers did not burst and release pollen. Typically, anthers open under low relative humidity (RH), whereas high RH can delay or prevent this process [The average number of female flowers produced was six, with an average of 4.4 seeds developing per inflorescence/plant. Low pollen grain viability might have led to incomplete fertilization, preventing some flowers from producing seeds. Another possibility is that the plant's small size could not support extensive seed development. Out of the collected seeds, only an average of 2.4 seeds per plant germinated (Table S1). However, achieving one successful succession per generation is sufficient for a breeding program aimed at hybrid seed production and generating numerous homozygous plants to test various combinations. Cannabis cultivars exhibit significant variability in inflorescence traits, including flowering time, architecture, number of flowers, flower size, and compaction [Cannabis cultivars grown in vitro exhibit differences in flowering patterns. Cannabis explants from three cultivars (TA5, Magic 9, and Sky 1) were cultured under vegetative conditions (18/6 h light/dark) for 17 days and then transferred to a 12/12 h cycle to induce flowering. This experiment demonstrates that different cultivars behave differently in tissue culture, and their inflorescence characteristics do not always match their growth room phenotype, suggesting an interaction between genetic background and in vitro growth conditions.", "response": "As a cooking show host interested in featuring more plant-based recipes on your show, I recommend reaching out to culinary experts who specialize in plant-based cooking to showcase diverse recipes and cooking methods.

Microbiota is a large community of microorganisms that grows in the stomach, small and large intestines. The majority of these microorganisms which are beneficial to human body are members of probiotics. The definition of probiotics defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) with minor modified by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) is \u201clive microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host\u201d (Salminen et al., Microencapsulation is an effective technology to help protect probiotics from stress conditions (Ammara et al., Corn which is abundant in Northern Thailand is a vegetable enriched with nutrients especially soluble corn fiber (SCF). SCF, a non-digestible oligosaccharide in digestive tract, is considered as prebiotics. Naturally, probiotics living in the GI tract digest this fiber into small molecules which can be absorbed into the intestine. To be classified as prebiotics, nutrients need to meet three criteria as followed. They must be digested by probiotics and are benefit to the body. They must not be digested or absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. The common prebiotics include oligosaccharide, raffinose, inulin and non-starch polysaccharides (Floch, A previous study from our group reported cholesterol lowering property of The proximate analysis of carrot juice was determined in terms of moisture, ash, protein, fiber, fat, and carbohydrates contents by following the protocol of the Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC 2000) described by [", "response": "For cancer survivors looking to optimize their diet for overall health and wellness, incorporating plant-based foods known for their anti-inflammatory properties can be beneficial. Some of these foods include turmeric, ginger, green leafy vegetables (such as kale and spinach), berries, nuts, seeds, and legumes. These foods contain antioxidants and phytochemicals that can help reduce inflammation in the body, which is beneficial for overall health and may also have potential benefits for cancer survivors.\n\nIn the context provided, it is mentioned that carrot juice contains nutrients such as protein, fiber, fat, and carbohydrates. Carrots are also rich in antioxidants and vitamins, making them a great addition to a plant-based diet. Additionally, the information about probiotics and prebiotics highlights the importance of gut health for overall wellness. Including probiotic-rich foods like fermented vegetables and prebiotic-rich foods like corn can support a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for immune function and overall health, especially for cancer survivors.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating a variety of plant-based foods with anti-inflammatory properties, such as turmeric, ginger, green leafy vegetables, berries, nuts, seeds, legumes, carrots, fermented vegetables, and corn, can help optimize your diet for overall health and wellness as a cancer survivor.

European countries are the early batch of countries in this field, whose attention to research is not decreasing at the current stage, followed by South American and Southeast Asian countries as the emerging research mainstay countries. In recent years, Croatia, Colombia, Slovenia, Chile, Egypt, China, and Thailand have become the dominant countries in this field. The Australian Catholic University is the top research organization in the field. Burke LM from Australia had the most publications. Research in this area has been published in Nutrients in Switzerland. The study population mainly comprised men, and postmenopausal women were the main focus of the female group. Coronary heart and cardiovascular diseases continue to dominate research in this field. A milestone was achieved when the consensus statement was published in large numbers in 2022, signaling the agreement of experts in the field on common issues as well as some specific issues. Insulin resistance, sports nutrition, inflammation, alpha-linolenic acid, limb strength performance, female sex, and gut microbiota are the focus of the current stage of research and future studies. Bibliometric analysis in the field of sports nutritional supplements was conducted with the support of three software packages, CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix\u2019s R, using visual mapping to reveal the development trends and patterns in the field with more intuitive images and to derive a series of new findings and interpretations. This study searched the literature covering only Web of Science core ensemble database articles, which excluded other sources of literature, such as books and reports, and chose a small coverage of data sources. This study mainly analyzes the number of publications, journals, authors, institutions, countries, and regions, as well as keywords, aiming to provide a macro-analysis of the field; therefore, some important details are not reflected in the study.

Research in the field of the NSSE can be divided into four stages: steady growth (2000\u20132007), exponential growth (2007\u20132013), fluctuation (2013\u20132017) and surge (2017\u20132024). The United States is the most active country in the field of nutritional supplements. European countries are the early batch of countries in this field, whose attention to research is not decreasing at the current stage, followed by South American and Southeast Asian countries as the emerging research mainstay countries. In recent years, Croatia, Colombia, Slovenia, Chile, Egypt, China, and Thailand have become the dominant countries in this field. The Australian Catholic University is the top research organization in the field. Burke LM from Australia had the most publications. Research in this area has been published in Nutrients in Switzerland. The study population mainly comprised men, and postmenopausal women were the main focus of the female group. Coronary heart and cardiovascular diseases continue to dominate research in this field. A milestone was achieved when the consensus statement was published in large numbers in 2022, signaling the agreement of experts in the field on common issues as well as some specific issues. Insulin resistance, sports nutrition, inflammation, alpha-linolenic acid, limb strength performance, female sex, and gut microbiota are the focus of the current stage of research and future studies.

WPI and MD have been wildly used as a mixture for microencapsulation because of their Maillard reaction\u2019s property. Corn which is often used as a raw material in many food industries due to its low cost has never been used as encapsulate material. Structure of corn powder is composed of carbohydrates, soluble corn fiber and fibers which are suitable to be used as a wall material. Thus, incorporation of corn powder into the mixture of WPI-MD might strengthen encapsulated surface. It has been reported that chemically modified whey protein and cornstarch formulated into resistant starch (RS) used as an encapsulated material exhibited significantly greater microencapsulation property and protection against environmental microbial destruction than RS alone (Free cells and microencapsulated probiotics were observed under a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. The morphology of probiotics microencapsulated.

Research in the field of the NSSE can be divided into four stages: steady growth (2000\u20132007), exponential growth (2007\u20132013), fluctuation (2013\u20132017) and surge (2017\u20132024). The United States is the most active country in the field of nutritional supplements. European countries are the early batch of countries in this field, whose attention to research is not decreasing at the current stage, followed by South American and Southeast Asian countries as the emerging research mainstay countries. In recent years, Croatia, Colombia, Slovenia, Chile, Egypt, China, and Thailand have become the dominant countries in this field. The Australian Catholic University is the top research organization in the field. Burke LM from Australia had the most publications. Research in this area has been published in Nutrients in Switzerland. The study population mainly comprised men, and postmenopausal women were the main focus of the female group. Coronary heart and cardiovascular diseases continue to dominate research in this field. A milestone was achieved when the consensus statement was published in large numbers in 2022, signaling the agreement of experts in the field on common issues as well as some specific issues. Insulin resistance, sports nutrition, inflammation, alpha-linolenic acid, limb strength performance, female sex, and gut microbiota are the focus of the current stage of research and future studies.

From a global perspective, North American countries, European countries, and Australia have close cooperation, Brazil contributes significantly to South American countries, and China produces a substantial amount of output in Asian countries. European countries, as the first countries to step into this field, are now at a stage where research attention is not decreasing, followed by South American and Southeast Asian countries as the new research mainstay.Top research organizations worldwide in the field of sports nutrition supplements have conducted in-depth studies in the following thematic directions: (1) The University of Copenhagen, Denmark, focuses on the fact that supplementation with anthocyanin-rich blueberry concentrate improves brain perfusion and activation in brain regions associated with cognitive function in healthy older adults [The top contributing authors and teams conducted in-depth research on the following topics: (1) The Kreider et al. team in the United States focuses on creatine supplementation to enhance post-exercise recovery, injury prevention, thermoregulation, rehabilitation, and concussion or spinal cord neuroprotection in addition to improving sports and exercise [Currently, the most controversial issue in the field is how NSSE should be characterized, in which the attributes of the product are ambiguous between dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals, whether they should be classified as prescription or over-the-counter, how their dosage should be standardized as a baseline, how they should be balanced with the diet after being added to an athlete\u2019s training schedule, and how their efficacy should be related to the indicators in promotional campaigns and their effectiveness in practical use. However, a large part of nutritional supplements can provide athletes with dimensions that cannot be reached in traditional training systems. By analyzing high-frequency keywords, it is clear that the focus of the study group shifted from children in 2000 [In summary, NSSE plays a vital role in athletes\u2019 sports nutrition programs and, if used properly, some supplements can assist athletes in achieving their sports nutrition goals. However, considerable effort and expertise are required to determine which products are appropriate, how to integrate them into an athlete\u2019s sports nutrition program, and how to ensure that any benefits outweigh the possible negative effects. Therefore, when deciding whether to use sports nutritional supplements, athletes and teams should weigh the efficacy against possible risks and controversies.

To be classified as prebiotics, nutrients need to meet three criteria as followed. They must be digested by probiotics and are benefit to the body. They must not be digested or absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. The common prebiotics include oligosaccharide, raffinose, inulin and non-starch polysaccharides (Floch, A previous study from our group reported cholesterol lowering property of BSH activities were observed in The differences in BSH activities of LAB isolates might be due to the influences of disparate environments on expressions of BSH genes (Song et al., Different vegetable powders including cherry tomato, beetroot, pumpkin, bok choy, and corn at 5% (w/v) were added into culture media of The viability of probiotics Moreover, addition of vegetable powders reduced probiotic deaths and stabilized the growth rates of probiotics during the stationary phase (Fig.\u00a0This study was the first study which integrated corn powder into the mixture of microcapsule material. Several studies have reported prebiotic effects of corn compositions. Consumption of SCF for two weeks significantly enhanced bifidobacterial numbers in healthy volunteers (Costabile et al., Before freeze drying, there were approximately 10The survival of probiotic free cells and encapsulated of probiotics before\u2013after freeze drying. WPI and MD have been wildly used as a mixture for microencapsulation because of their Maillard reaction\u2019s property. Corn which is often used as a raw material in many food industries due to its low cost has never been used as encapsulate material. Structure of corn powder is composed of carbohydrates, soluble corn fiber and fibers which are suitable to be used as a wall material. Thus, incorporation of corn powder into the mixture of WPI-MD might strengthen encapsulated surface. It has been reported that chemically modified whey protein and cornstarch formulated into resistant starch (RS) used as an encapsulated material exhibited significantly greater microencapsulation property and protection against environmental microbial destruction than RS alone (Free cells and microencapsulated probiotics were observed under a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. The morphology of probiotics microencapsulated.

From a global perspective, North American countries, European countries, and Australia have close cooperation, Brazil contributes significantly to South American countries, and China produces a substantial amount of output in Asian countries. European countries, as the first countries to step into this field, are now at a stage where research attention is not decreasing, followed by South American and Southeast Asian countries as the new research mainstay.Top research organizations worldwide in the field of sports nutrition supplements have conducted in-depth studies in the following thematic directions: (1) The University of Copenhagen, Denmark, focuses on the fact that supplementation with anthocyanin-rich blueberry concentrate improves brain perfusion and activation in brain regions associated with cognitive function in healthy older adults [The top contributing authors and teams conducted in-depth research on the following topics: (1) The Kreider et al. team in the United States focuses on creatine supplementation to enhance post-exercise recovery, injury prevention, thermoregulation, rehabilitation, and concussion or spinal cord neuroprotection in addition to improving sports and exercise [Currently, the most controversial issue in the field is how NSSE should be characterized, in which the attributes of the product are ambiguous between dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals, whether they should be classified as prescription or over-the-counter, how their dosage should be standardized as a baseline, how they should be balanced with the diet after being added to an athlete\u2019s training schedule, and how their efficacy should be related to the indicators in promotional campaigns and their effectiveness in practical use. However, a large part of nutritional supplements can provide athletes with dimensions that cannot be reached in traditional training systems. By analyzing high-frequency keywords, it is clear that the focus of the study group shifted from children in 2000 [In summary, NSSE plays a vital role in athletes\u2019 sports nutrition programs and, if used properly, some supplements can assist athletes in achieving their sports nutrition goals. However, considerable effort and expertise are required to determine which products are appropriate, how to integrate them into an athlete\u2019s sports nutrition program, and how to ensure that any benefits outweigh the possible negative effects. Therefore, when deciding whether to use sports nutritional supplements, athletes and teams should weigh the efficacy against possible risks and controversies. In future research and practice, more scientific evidence and regulatory measures are required to address the current controversies and issues and promote the rational use and development of sports nutrition supplements.

The common prebiotics include oligosaccharide, raffinose, inulin and non-starch polysaccharides (Floch, A previous study from our group reported cholesterol lowering property of Different vegetable powders including cherry tomato, beetroot, pumpkin, bok choy, and corn at 5% (w/v) were added into culture media of The viability of probiotics Moreover, addition of vegetable powders reduced probiotic deaths and stabilized the growth rates of probiotics during the stationary phase (Fig.\u00a0This study was the first study which integrated corn powder into the mixture of microcapsule material. Several studies have reported prebiotic effects of corn compositions. Consumption of SCF for two weeks significantly enhanced bifidobacterial numbers in healthy volunteers (Costabile et al., BSH activities were observed in The differences in BSH activities of LAB isolates might be due to the influences of disparate environments on expressions of BSH genes (Song et al., Different vegetable powders including cherry tomato, beetroot, pumpkin, bok choy, and corn at 5% (w/v) were added into culture media of The viability of probiotics Moreover, addition of vegetable powders reduced probiotic deaths and stabilized the growth rates of probiotics during the stationary phase (Fig.\u00a0This study was the first study which integrated corn powder into the mixture of microcapsule material. Several studies have reported prebiotic effects of corn compositions. Consumption of SCF for two weeks significantly enhanced bifidobacterial numbers in healthy volunteers (Costabile et al., Before freeze drying, there were approximately 10The survival of probiotic free cells and encapsulated of probiotics before\u2013after freeze drying. WPI and MD have been wildly used as a mixture for microencapsulation because of their Maillard reaction\u2019s property. Corn which is often used as a raw material in many food industries due to its low cost has never been used as encapsulate material. Structure of corn powder is composed of carbohydrates, soluble corn fiber and fibers which are suitable to be used as a wall material. Thus, incorporation of corn powder into the mixture of WPI-MD might strengthen encapsulated surface. It has been reported that chemically modified whey protein and cornstarch formulated into resistant starch (RS) used as an encapsulated material exhibited significantly greater microencapsulation property and protection against environmental microbial destruction than RS alone (Free cells and microencapsulated probiotics were observed under a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. The morphology of probiotics microencapsulated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of free cells (It was the first time that this structure was studied and reported. Combination of WPI, MD, and corn formed a reticulum-like structure wrapped in another layer which potentially increasing the encapsulation efficiency (Yan et al., Survivals of microencapsulated probiotics in simulated gastrointestinal conditions were examined using artificial gastric and intestinal fluids.

Consider including foods like corn, cherry tomatoes, beetroot, pumpkin, and bok choy as they have shown to have prebiotic effects and can support the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. These foods contain soluble corn fiber (SCF) which acts as a prebiotic, helping to feed the probiotics in your gut and promote a healthy microbiome. Additionally, consider incorporating probiotic-rich foods like fermented plant-based foods (e.g., kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh) to introduce more beneficial bacteria into your gut. Microencapsulation technology can help protect probiotics and increase their effectiveness, so seek out probiotic supplements that utilize this technology for maximum benefits. Overall, focusing on a diverse array of plant-based foods rich in prebiotics and probiotics can help support your gut health and improve digestive issues.\n\nBased on the provided context, this advice is justified as it takes into account the specific benefits of prebiotic-rich foods like corn and the importance of using microencapsulation technology to protect probiotics effectively."}]
