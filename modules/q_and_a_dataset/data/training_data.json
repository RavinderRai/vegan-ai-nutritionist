        "response": "Given your recent weight loss surgery and need to increase protein intake without tolerating dairy well, I recommend incorporating plant-based protein sources into your diet. Some excellent sources include beans, lentils, chickpeas, tofu, tempeh, quinoa, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. These foods are not only high in protein but also provide essential nutrients and fiber to support your overall health and weight loss goals. \n\nBased on the context provided, it is essential to focus on natural, whole food sources of protein rather than relying on nutritional supplements. While some supplements may assist in achieving sports nutrition goals, they should not be the primary source of protein in your diet, especially after undergoing weight loss surgery. Whole foods offer a wide range of nutrients that work together synergistically to support your body's needs.\n\nAdditionally, consulting with a registered dietitian who specializes in plant-based diets can help tailor a personalized meal plan that meets your protein needs while supporting your weight loss journey. They can also help ensure you are consuming a balanced diet that promotes healing post-surgery and aids in sustainable weight loss."

        "context": "This study presents the first extensive overview of sports nutritional supplement research through bibliometric and visual analyses and provides useful insights and analyses on future research directions. Research in the field of the NSSE can be divided into four stages: steady growth (2000\u20132007), exponential growth (2007\u20132013), fluctuation (2013\u20132017) and surge (2017\u20132024). The United States is the most active country in the field of nutritional supplements. European countries are the early batch of countries in this field, whose attention to research is not decreasing at the current stage, followed by South American and Southeast Asian countries as the emerging research mainstay countries. In recent years, Croatia, Colombia, Slovenia, Chile, Egypt, China, and Thailand have become the dominant countries in this field. The Australian Catholic University is the top research organization in the field. Burke LM from Australia had the most publications. Research in this area has been published in Nutrients in Switzerland. The study population mainly comprised men, and postmenopausal women were the main focus of the female group. Coronary heart and cardiovascular diseases continue to dominate research in this field. A milestone was achieved when the consensus statement was published in large numbers in 2022, signaling the agreement of experts in the field on common issues as well as some specific issues. Insulin resistance, sports nutrition, inflammation, alpha-linolenic acid, limb strength performance, female sex, and gut microbiota are the focus of the current stage of research and future studies. For all analyses performed in this work, we used full-bloom flowers (Fig.\u00a0Corolla and calyxes of the three The seeds of The function of miRNAs in maintaining N and Pi homeostasis can be explored by fine-tuning the Widely-used methods and technologies for accelerating plant breeding via fine-tuning Currently, the physiological and molecular verification and application of transgenic plants represents the most critical step for the implementation of basic research and the advancement of sustainable agriculture.

Estimation of nutrients and heavy metals.Concentrations of nutrients (Ca, Na, P, Mg, K) and heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) in carrot juice were estimated by digesting of nitric acid (HNO Plants have evolved miRNA-target modules to regulate the tolerance to nutrient stress, some of which are evolutionarily related to environmental adaptation. A single miRNA may target more than one transcript, and vice versa, to fine-tune the expression of genes, which converges into a sophisticated and extremely fault-tolerant crosstalk. Accumulating findings highlight that miRNAs furnish a bridge for the transportation and stockpile of N and Pi nutrition in the plants, plant-environment interactions, and plant-plant communications through the modulation of N and Pi signaling transduction.The main themes that emerged from previous studies are the role of miRNAs in enhancing NUE and PUE of plants, as well as the adaptive responses of plants to N and Pi stresses. Destructive effects of nutrient stress on plants are largely dependent on the inheritance and variation of plants and the influence of the environment due to the immobility of plants and the complexity of the environment. One area of future research that needs to be addressed in more detail concerns the function of miRNAs in the communications between plants and the environment. For example, the role of plant symbionts in exporting sRNA to induce transboundary gene silencing to improve N and Pi homeostasis of plants has not been well reported and requires further investigation. In addition, future studies on miRNA*s as underappreciated regulatory components would also expand our understanding of The research directions mainly focus on the upstream regulatory mechanisms and the downstream regulatory roles of miRNAs responding to nutrient stress. In particular, the upstream regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs are still in their infancy, such as the mechanisms by which miRNAs are loaded for precise regulation. For instance, in Arabidopsis, Pi starvation significantly increases the expression of miR778, miR827, and miR2111, and inhibits the expression of miR168, miR395, and miR398. Interestingly, the expression of miR778 and miR2111 quickly decrease by approximately two folds within three hours of the restored Pi supply (Paul et al. Fine-tuning",

In recent years, the consumption of edible flowers for human nutrition has increased considerably worldwide (Fernandes et al. Among the edible plant taxa with very tasty flowers are basils: they are sweet due to the presence of drops of nectar, while the aromatic notes vary depending on the cultivars and hybrids. One of the most famous, Many basil cultivars are cultivated to harvest the leaves, which are used to make the \u201cpesto\u201d sauce ('Genovese' or 'Italiko') (Laura et al. Basil\u2019s aroma is determined by several volatile aromatic compounds released by flowers and leaves: the composition, concentration, and ratios of these aromatic compounds influence the sensory features. The secondary compounds (such as terpenes and phenylpropanoids) that constitute essential oils (EOs) are synthesized and stored in the glandular trichomes (mainly capitate and peltate trichomes) present on the epidermis of basil leaves and flowers (Gang et al. The presence of specific secondary compounds was found to be indicative of a particular taste: for example, the presence of linalool imparts a sweet/floral taste; eucalyptol is responsible for the fresh/eucalyptus-like aroma; eugenol tastes like clove; methyl chavicol resembles the anise aroma; methyl cinnamate is responsible for the cinnamon flavour; citral, neral, and geranial are linked to a citrus aroma (Brechbill While data on the distribution and types of trichomes responsible for the production of essential oils in basil leaves are available in the literature (Werker The recent increased consumption of edible flowers has led to a more complex production chain and the delivery of packaged commercial compositions (Marchioni et al. Among the tools used for taxa identification, the DNA barcoding approach is gaining more and more importance as a reliable molecular method, and it is now widely used as a tool to disentangle the provenance of food products (Galimberti et al.

        "response": "For managing your IBS symptoms with a plant-based diet, focus on incorporating foods that are gentle on the digestive system. Opt for soluble fiber-rich foods like bananas, oats, and chia seeds, as they can help regulate bowel movements and ease constipation or diarrhea associated with IBS. Additionally, include probiotic-rich foods like sauerkraut, tempeh, and miso to support gut health and reduce symptoms of bloating and gas. Avoid trigger foods such as artificial sweeteners, caffeine, and high-fat foods, as they can exacerbate symptoms of IBS.\n\nBased on the information provided in the context, carrot juice can be a good addition to your plant-based diet as it is low in FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides, and polyols) and may help alleviate symptoms of IBS. Carrots are also rich in vitamins and minerals, contributing to overall gut health. Be mindful of how your body reacts to different plant-based foods and adjust your diet accordingly to manage your IBS symptoms effectively."

Microbiota is a large community of microorganisms that grows in the stomach, small and large intestines. The majority of these microorganisms which are beneficial to human body are members of probiotics. The definition of probiotics defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) with minor modified by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) is \u201clive microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host\u201d (Salminen et al., Microencapsulation is an effective technology to help protect probiotics from stress conditions (Ammara et al., Corn which is abundant in Northern Thailand is a vegetable enriched with nutrients especially soluble corn fiber (SCF). SCF, a non-digestible oligosaccharide in digestive tract, is considered as prebiotics. Naturally, probiotics living in the GI tract digest this fiber into small molecules which can be absorbed into the intestine. To be classified as prebiotics, nutrients need to meet three criteria as followed. They must be digested by probiotics and are benefit to the body. They must not be digested or absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. The common prebiotics include oligosaccharide, raffinose, inulin and non-starch polysaccharides (Floch, A previous study from our group reported cholesterol lowering property of The proximate analysis of carrot juice was determined in terms of moisture, ash, protein, fiber, fat, and carbohydrates contents by following the protocol of the Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC 2000) described by [",
        "response": "Plants known for their anti-inflammatory properties that may benefit cancer survivors include dark leafy greens (such as kale and spinach), berries (like blueberries and strawberries), nuts and seeds (such as walnuts and chia seeds), and turmeric. These foods are rich in antioxidants and phytonutrients that can help reduce inflammation and support overall health.\n\nIn the context provided, the mention of probiotics and prebiotics is also important for cancer survivors. Consuming foods rich in probiotics, like fermented foods (such as sauerkraut and kimchi) and yogurt, can help support a healthy gut microbiome. Additionally, incorporating prebiotic foods like corn with soluble corn fiber can further support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. A healthy gut microbiome is crucial for overall health and can also play a role in reducing inflammation and supporting the immune system, which is important for cancer survivors.\n\nUltimately, a plant-based diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods, probiotics, and prebiotics can help optimize your diet for overall health and wellness as a cancer survivor. Remember to focus on variety, balance, and moderation in your plant-based choices to ensure you are meeting your nutrient needs."

        "response": "To ensure you are meeting all your nutrient needs on a plant-based diet, focus on incorporating a variety of whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Make sure to include sources of protein like beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, and edamame. Incorporate sources of healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. \n\nBased on the information provided, it is important to pay attention to your intake of minerals and vitamins in order to maintain a balanced diet. Make sure to include sources of calcium (from fortified plant-based milk or leafy greens), iron (from legumes, tofu, and fortified cereals), zinc (from nuts, seeds, and whole grains), and vitamin A (from carrots, sweet potatoes, and leafy greens).\n\nAdditionally, consider incorporating carrot juice into your diet for its high content of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibers. Carrot juice can contribute positively to your overall nutrient intake, especially in terms of vitamins A, C, and K, as well as minerals like calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Make sure to monitor your intake of heavy metals like lead, cadmium, and mercury, as they can be present in some plant-based foods due to environmental contamination. Consider opting for organic produce and properly washing fruits and vegetables to reduce heavy metal exposure."
