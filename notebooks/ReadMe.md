# Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks where initial exploration was done. For the fully functioning refactored code see the modules folder.

To use these notebooks, you can reuse the poetry environments defined in the respective modules folders, i.e., to run the data_ingstion.ipynb notebook, navigate to the modules/data/ingestion/ folder in a terminal and run 

```bash
poetry shell
```

to start the environment. Then execute the command `jupyter notebook`. Next click on the `Select Kernel` button at the top right, and select `Existing Jupyter Server...`. Finally copy and paste the localhost link in there and hit enter.
