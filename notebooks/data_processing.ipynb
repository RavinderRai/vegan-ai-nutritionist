       "   'p': 'A network of 15 Surface Elevation Tables (SETs) at North Inlet estuary, South Carolina, has been monitored on annual or monthly time scales beginning from 1990 to 1996 and continuing through 2022. Of 73 time series in control plots, 12 had elevation gains equal to or exceeding the local rate of sea-level rise (SLR, 0.34\\xa0cm/year). Rising marsh elevation in North Inlet is dominated by organic production and, we hypothesize, is proportional to net ecosystem production. The rate of elevation gain was 0.47\\xa0cm/year in plots experimentally fertilized for 10\\xa0years with N&P compared to nearby control plots that have gained 0.1\\xa0cm/year in 26\\xa0years. The excess gains and losses of elevation in fertilized plots were accounted for by changes in belowground biomass and turnover. This is supported by bioassay experiments in marsh organs where at age 2 the belowground biomass of fertilized S. alterniflora plants was increasing by 1,994\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2\\xa0year^−1, which added a growth premium of 2.4\\xa0cm/year to elevation gain. This was contrasted with the net belowground growth of 746\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2\\xa0year^−1 in controls, which can add 0.89\\xa0cm/year to elevation. Root biomass density was greater in the fertilized bioassay treatments than in controls, plateauing at about 1,374\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 and 472\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2, respectively. Growth of belowground biomass was dominated by rhizomes, which grew to 3,648\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 in the fertilized treatments after 3\\xa0years and 1,439\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 in the control treatments after 5\\xa0years. Depositional wetlands are limited by an exogenous supply of mineral sediment, whereas marshes like North Inlet could be classified as autonomous because they depend on in situ organic production to maintain elevation. Autonomous wetlands are more vulnerable to SLR because their elevation gains are constrained ultimately by photosynthetic efficiency.'}},\n",

Studies using the Surface Elevation Table–Marker Horizon (SET-MH) method are advancing our understanding of the processes contributing to the sustainability of coastal wetland elevation in the face of rising sea levels, and their management implications, resulting in an approach that allows for comprehensive and systematic monitoring of wetland elevation change over a wide range of coastal environments globally. Collectively, the 27 articles in this special issue present an examination of current advances at quantifying and understanding subsurface process influences on wetland elevation change and wetland responses to sea-level rise, drawing on research presentations from two special sessions at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) 2021 conference plus additional recent research describing scientific insights gained from the SET-MH method. These insights include information from research on the five thematic topics presented below.

This viewpoint suggests that there are exciting prospects to reformulate meat products that are produced more sustainably and may also have health benefits by substituting high-protein nonmeat ingredients for some of the meat. Considering these pre-existing conditions, this review critically reviews recent data on extenders from several sources, including pulses, plant-based components, plant byproducts, and unconventional sources. We used the related keywords from Scopus-database without limiting the publishing date. With an emphasis on how these findings may impact the sustainability of meat products, it sees them as a great chance to enhance the functional quality and technological profile of meat. Therefore, to promote sustainability, meat alternatives such as plant-based meat equivalents are being made available. To boost consumer acceptability of these goods, further initiatives should also be developed to enhance the functioning of these innovative food items and increase public knowledge of plant-based meat analogues.'}}"

Therefore to increase the fat content minimally fractionated soy that contains higher fat is used in the manufacturing of fibrous structures like meat analogues [In meat analogues, different flavour generation components and their critical interaction during processing have a crucial role in mimicking specific meat-like tastes and flavors. Meat analogue's taste and flavour predominate its acceptance as a meat alternative to the consumer. Uses of different spices, seasonings, herbs, sugars, salts, and savoury aromas, and their binding capacity to the plant proteins through the extrusion process are directly responsible for meat-like flavour generation [In the consumer's opinion, color is the most important parameter to create a visual appeal for meat analogues in their mind. Each meat has some specific color that changes through different processes such as cooking and smoking. Similarly, meat analogues should have meat mimic color and color change characteristics during processing. Several heat colorings agents such as malt or annatto, turmin, leghemoglobin, erythrosine, cumin, caramel colors, carotene, canthaxanthin, and lycopene have been used to incorporate the meat color and color change characteristics in the meat analogues [Meat analogues are made by combining a variety of ingredients through different texturizing techniques. For optimum binding of all the necessary ingredients (flavor, color, stabilizers, emulsifier, thickeners) several binding and texturing agents such as different natural gums (xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum), carrageenan, hydrocolloids (methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), wheat gluten, soy protein concentrate, casein are used [In meat analogues, water is a multi-functional ingredient, primarily from providing a hydration effect to the critical conformational change in protein water plays a crucial part in the designing of PBMA. In the extrusion process, high moisture content promotes greater hydrophobic interaction and the creation of disulfide bonds, and H-bonds [Nowadays PBMA is gaining attention worldwide.

       "  'p': 'Animal proteins from meat and its stuffs have recently been one of main concerns in the drive for sustainable food production. This viewpoint suggests that there are exciting prospects to reformulate meat products that are produced more sustainably and may also have health benefits by substituting high-protein nonmeat ingredients for some of the meat. Considering these pre-existing conditions, this review critically reviews recent data on extenders from several sources, including pulses, plant-based components, plant byproducts, and unconventional sources. We used the related keywords from Scopus-database without limiting the publishing date. With an emphasis on how these findings may impact the sustainability of meat products, it sees them as a great chance to enhance the functional quality and technological profile of meat. Therefore, to promote sustainability, meat alternatives such as plant-based meat equivalents are being made available. To boost consumer acceptability of these goods, further initiatives should also be developed to enhance the functioning of these innovative food items and increase public knowledge of plant-based meat analogues.'},\n",

       "'Accelerating relative sea-level rise (RSLR) threatens coastal wetlands globally, and their survival depends on the ability of wetlands to build soil vertically and maintain their elevation in the tidal frame. Studies using the Surface Elevation Table–Marker Horizon (SET-MH) method are advancing our understanding of the processes contributing to the sustainability of coastal wetland elevation in the face of rising sea levels, and their management implications, resulting in an approach that allows for comprehensive and systematic monitoring of wetland elevation change over a wide range of coastal environments globally. Collectively, the 27 articles in this special issue present an examination of current advances at quantifying and understanding subsurface process influences on wetland elevation change and wetland responses to sea-level rise, drawing on research presentations from two special sessions at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) 2021 conference plus additional recent research describing scientific insights gained from the SET-MH method. These insights include information from research on the five thematic topics presented below. This special issue should be of great value to everyone interested in the latest advances in coastal wetland elevation dynamics using the SET-MH technique.A 30-year retrospective on the scientific insights gained on the surface and shallow subsurface processes influencing wetland elevation dynamics using the SET-MH method, including fundamental revelations about tidal wetland elevation dynamics.The development and evolution of the SET-MH technique has led to the recognition that coastal wetland soil elevation dynamics are driven by complex interactions among surface and subsurface processes (Cahoon Investigations of the subsurface soil process influences on wetland elevation\\xa0(e.g., Maher and Starke Essential plant nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are often in limited supply in tidal wetlands, thereby restricting plant growth and soil organic matter accumulation influences on elevation gain. Nutrient enrichment in oligotrophic wetlands from sediment addition, nutrient pollution, or fertilization can lead to increased plant growth, soil organic matter accumulation, and wetland elevation gain (see\\xa0Table\\xa03 in Cahoon How the scientific community applies the SET–MH method to quantify and understand wetland responses to RSLR and other environmental drivers such as altered hydrology and sediment supply, changes in plant production, and management and restoration actions through statistical analyses of changes in surface elevation, and how the information gained can be used to inform management decisions.Wetland elevation trend responses to RSLR are shown to vary by lateral position within the estuary for salt marshes (e.g., riverine, bayside, and barrier island settings; Steinmuller et al. How SET-MH data are used in long-term monitoring networks at different geographic scales where the distance among network sites ranges from local (i.e., 10\\xa0s of kilometers) to regional (i.e., 100\\xa0s of kilometers) to national (i.e., 1000\\xa0s of kilometers), and what complementary datasets will enhance comparisons to environmental drivers such as RSLR.Local networks are used to assess environmental gradients in a coastal sound or bay, such as distance from a sediment source (e.g., ocean inlet (Roman et al. Multidecadal datasets from regional networks in the USA covering multiple sounds and bays in California (Thorne et al. A national network of 289 SET-MH stations spanning a range of tidal wetland types across mainland Australian coastal states and territories (Saintilan et al. Pairing the SET-MH method with survey techniques to increase lateral coverage of wetland elevation trends and with geodetic techniques to increase vertical coverage of vertical land motion, including both shallow and deep subsidence, thereby improving our understanding of coastal wetland elevation dynamics and responses to RSLR.An individual rod SET station measures elevation across an approximate 1.5 mWhen comparing a SET wetland elevation trend to a nearby tide gauge RSLR trend, the underlying assumption is that deep subsidence rates are the same beneath both the wetland and the tide station (Cahoon '"
