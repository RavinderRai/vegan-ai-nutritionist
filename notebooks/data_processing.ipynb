       "   'p': 'A network of 15 Surface Elevation Tables (SETs) at North Inlet estuary, South Carolina, has been monitored on annual or monthly time scales beginning from 1990 to 1996 and continuing through 2022. Of 73 time series in control plots, 12 had elevation gains equal to or exceeding the local rate of sea-level rise (SLR, 0.34\\xa0cm/year). Rising marsh elevation in North Inlet is dominated by organic production and, we hypothesize, is proportional to net ecosystem production. The rate of elevation gain was 0.47\\xa0cm/year in plots experimentally fertilized for 10\\xa0years with N&P compared to nearby control plots that have gained 0.1\\xa0cm/year in 26\\xa0years. The excess gains and losses of elevation in fertilized plots were accounted for by changes in belowground biomass and turnover. This is supported by bioassay experiments in marsh organs where at age 2 the belowground biomass of fertilized S. alterniflora plants was increasing by 1,994\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2\\xa0year^−1, which added a growth premium of 2.4\\xa0cm/year to elevation gain. This was contrasted with the net belowground growth of 746\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2\\xa0year^−1 in controls, which can add 0.89\\xa0cm/year to elevation. Root biomass density was greater in the fertilized bioassay treatments than in controls, plateauing at about 1,374\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 and 472\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2, respectively. Growth of belowground biomass was dominated by rhizomes, which grew to 3,648\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 in the fertilized treatments after 3\\xa0years and 1,439\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 in the control treatments after 5\\xa0years. Depositional wetlands are limited by an exogenous supply of mineral sediment, whereas marshes like North Inlet could be classified as autonomous because they depend on in situ organic production to maintain elevation. Autonomous wetlands are more vulnerable to SLR because their elevation gains are constrained ultimately by photosynthetic efficiency.'}},\n",

       "   'body': 'Accelerating relative sea-level rise (RSLR) threatens coastal wetlands globally, and their survival depends on the ability of wetlands to build soil vertically and maintain their elevation in the tidal frame. Studies using the Surface Elevation Table–Marker Horizon (SET-MH) method are advancing our understanding of the processes contributing to the sustainability of coastal wetland elevation in the face of rising sea levels, and their management implications, resulting in an approach that allows for comprehensive and systematic monitoring of wetland elevation change over a wide range of coastal environments globally. Collectively, the 27 articles in this special issue present an examination of current advances at quantifying and understanding subsurface process influences on wetland elevation change and wetland responses to sea-level rise, drawing on research presentations from two special sessions at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) 2021 conference plus additional recent research describing scientific insights gained from the SET-MH method. These insights include information from research on the five thematic topics presented below. This special issue should be of great value to everyone interested in the latest advances in coastal wetland elevation dynamics using the SET-MH technique.A 30-year retrospective on the scientific insights gained on the surface and shallow subsurface processes influencing wetland elevation dynamics using the SET-MH method, including fundamental revelations about tidal wetland elevation dynamics.The development and evolution of the SET-MH technique has led to the recognition that coastal wetland soil elevation dynamics are driven by complex interactions among surface and subsurface processes (Cahoon Investigations of the subsurface soil process influences on wetland elevation\\xa0(e.g., Maher and Starke Essential plant nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are often in limited supply in tidal wetlands, thereby restricting plant growth and soil organic matter accumulation influences on elevation gain.
