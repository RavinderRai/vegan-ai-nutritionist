       "   'p': 'A network of 15 Surface Elevation Tables (SETs) at North Inlet estuary, South Carolina, has been monitored on annual or monthly time scales beginning from 1990 to 1996 and continuing through 2022. Of 73 time series in control plots, 12 had elevation gains equal to or exceeding the local rate of sea-level rise (SLR, 0.34\\xa0cm/year). Rising marsh elevation in North Inlet is dominated by organic production and, we hypothesize, is proportional to net ecosystem production. The rate of elevation gain was 0.47\\xa0cm/year in plots experimentally fertilized for 10\\xa0years with N&P compared to nearby control plots that have gained 0.1\\xa0cm/year in 26\\xa0years. The excess gains and losses of elevation in fertilized plots were accounted for by changes in belowground biomass and turnover. This is supported by bioassay experiments in marsh organs where at age 2 the belowground biomass of fertilized S. alterniflora plants was increasing by 1,994\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2\\xa0year^−1, which added a growth premium of 2.4\\xa0cm/year to elevation gain. This was contrasted with the net belowground growth of 746\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2\\xa0year^−1 in controls, which can add 0.89\\xa0cm/year to elevation. Root biomass density was greater in the fertilized bioassay treatments than in controls, plateauing at about 1,374\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 and 472\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2, respectively. Growth of belowground biomass was dominated by rhizomes, which grew to 3,648\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 in the fertilized treatments after 3\\xa0years and 1,439\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 in the control treatments after 5\\xa0years. Depositional wetlands are limited by an exogenous supply of mineral sediment, whereas marshes like North Inlet could be classified as autonomous because they depend on in situ organic production to maintain elevation. Autonomous wetlands are more vulnerable to SLR because their elevation gains are constrained ultimately by photosynthetic efficiency.'}},\n",

Studies using the Surface Elevation Table–Marker Horizon (SET-MH) method are advancing our understanding of the processes contributing to the sustainability of coastal wetland elevation in the face of rising sea levels, and their management implications, resulting in an approach that allows for comprehensive and systematic monitoring of wetland elevation change over a wide range of coastal environments globally. Collectively, the 27 articles in this special issue present an examination of current advances at quantifying and understanding subsurface process influences on wetland elevation change and wetland responses to sea-level rise, drawing on research presentations from two special sessions at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) 2021 conference plus additional recent research describing scientific insights gained from the SET-MH method. These insights include information from research on the five thematic topics presented below.

This viewpoint suggests that there are exciting prospects to reformulate meat products that are produced more sustainably and may also have health benefits by substituting high-protein nonmeat ingredients for some of the meat. Considering these pre-existing conditions, this review critically reviews recent data on extenders from several sources, including pulses, plant-based components, plant byproducts, and unconventional sources. We used the related keywords from Scopus-database without limiting the publishing date. With an emphasis on how these findings may impact the sustainability of meat products, it sees them as a great chance to enhance the functional quality and technological profile of meat. Therefore, to promote sustainability, meat alternatives such as plant-based meat equivalents are being made available. To boost consumer acceptability of these goods, further initiatives should also be developed to enhance the functioning of these innovative food items and increase public knowledge of plant-based meat analogues.'}}"

Therefore to increase the fat content minimally fractionated soy that contains higher fat is used in the manufacturing of fibrous structures like meat analogues [In meat analogues, different flavour generation components and their critical interaction during processing have a crucial role in mimicking specific meat-like tastes and flavors. Meat analogue's taste and flavour predominate its acceptance as a meat alternative to the consumer. Uses of different spices, seasonings, herbs, sugars, salts, and savoury aromas, and their binding capacity to the plant proteins through the extrusion process are directly responsible for meat-like flavour generation [In the consumer's opinion, color is the most important parameter to create a visual appeal for meat analogues in their mind. Each meat has some specific color that changes through different processes such as cooking and smoking. Similarly, meat analogues should have meat mimic color and color change characteristics during processing. Several heat colorings agents such as malt or annatto, turmin, leghemoglobin, erythrosine, cumin, caramel colors, carotene, canthaxanthin, and lycopene have been used to incorporate the meat color and color change characteristics in the meat analogues [Meat analogues are made by combining a variety of ingredients through different texturizing techniques. For optimum binding of all the necessary ingredients (flavor, color, stabilizers, emulsifier, thickeners) several binding and texturing agents such as different natural gums (xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum), carrageenan, hydrocolloids (methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), wheat gluten, soy protein concentrate, casein are used [In meat analogues, water is a multi-functional ingredient, primarily from providing a hydration effect to the critical conformational change in protein water plays a crucial part in the designing of PBMA. In the extrusion process, high moisture content promotes greater hydrophobic interaction and the creation of disulfide bonds, and H-bonds [Nowadays PBMA is gaining attention worldwide.

       "  'p': 'Animal proteins from meat and its stuffs have recently been one of main concerns in the drive for sustainable food production. This viewpoint suggests that there are exciting prospects to reformulate meat products that are produced more sustainably and may also have health benefits by substituting high-protein nonmeat ingredients for some of the meat. Considering these pre-existing conditions, this review critically reviews recent data on extenders from several sources, including pulses, plant-based components, plant byproducts, and unconventional sources. We used the related keywords from Scopus-database without limiting the publishing date. With an emphasis on how these findings may impact the sustainability of meat products, it sees them as a great chance to enhance the functional quality and technological profile of meat. Therefore, to promote sustainability, meat alternatives such as plant-based meat equivalents are being made available. To boost consumer acceptability of these goods, further initiatives should also be developed to enhance the functioning of these innovative food items and increase public knowledge of plant-based meat analogues.'},\n",

Each meat has some specific color that changes through different processes such as cooking and smoking. Similarly, meat analogues should have meat mimic color and color change characteristics during processing. Several heat colorings agents such as malt or annatto, turmin, leghemoglobin, erythrosine, cumin, caramel colors, carotene, canthaxanthin, and lycopene have been used to incorporate the meat color and color change characteristics in the meat analogues [Meat analogues are made by combining a variety of ingredients through different texturizing techniques.

Among all the cereal proteins, wheat gluten is extensively used due to its low cost and excellent viscoelastic properties which makes it suitable to bind flavour, color, and other ingredients that result in the making of excellent meat analogues [Besides all the above-discussed proteins, several other types of proteins are there such as—corn zein protein, peanuts, potato proteins, pumpkin, etc. can be used in the development of PBMA. Several research studies have already performed such as peanut flour being used in replace of soya flour, potato protein, and corn zein are blended to develop meat mimics the gel-like structure, but no clear results have been obtained till now [The bottom-up design of proteins needed to develop meat analoguesLipids have important functions in terms of providing the meat with juiciness, flavour release, and tenderness in the PBMA. Generally, meat analogues are developed from defatted protein sources that result in lesser fat content in the meat analogues. Therefore to increase the fat content minimally fractionated soy that contains higher fat is used in the manufacturing of fibrous structures like meat analogues [In meat analogues, different flavour generation components and their critical interaction during processing have a crucial role in mimicking specific meat-like tastes and flavors. Meat analogue's taste and flavour predominate its acceptance as a meat alternative to the consumer. Uses of different spices, seasonings, herbs, sugars, salts, and savoury aromas, and their binding capacity to the plant proteins through the extrusion process are directly responsible for meat-like flavour generation [In the consumer's opinion, color is the most important parameter to create a visual appeal for meat analogues in their mind. Each meat has some specific color that changes through different processes such as cooking and smoking. Similarly, meat analogues should have meat mimic color and color change characteristics during processing. Several heat colorings agents such as malt or annatto, turmin, leghemoglobin, erythrosine, cumin, caramel colors, carotene, canthaxanthin, and lycopene have been used to incorporate the meat color and color change characteristics in the meat analogues [Meat analogues are made by combining a variety of ingredients through different texturizing techniques. For optimum binding of all the necessary ingredients (flavor, color, stabilizers, emulsifier, thickeners) several binding and texturing agents such as different natural gums (xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum), carrageenan, hydrocolloids (methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), wheat gluten, soy protein concentrate, casein are used [In meat analogues, water is a multi-functional ingredient, primarily from providing a hydration effect to the critical conformational change in protein water plays a crucial part in the designing of PBMA. In the extrusion process, high moisture content promotes greater hydrophobic interaction and the creation of disulfide bonds, and H-bonds [\"]\n",

The superscript letter “a” indicates the value is compared between the sample with and without processing operationWater retention/holding capacity represents the ability to hold water without protein dissolving, which influences food texture, shelf-life, and quality characteristics of the meat analogues [Fat retention capacity is a measurement of the ability of non-polar side chains of proteins to bind fat. It plays a potent character in improving the flavor of meat analogues and reducing the rate of fat oxidization [The emulsion property of proteins is commonly measured by the emulsification capability index (EAI) and emulsification stability index (ESI). EAI evaluates the capacity of a protein to adsorb at the water–oil interface and reduce interfacial tension, whereas ESI is a measure of the ability of an emulsion to maintain its structure stable over a defined period [Foaming property is evaluated by the foaming capability index (FCI) and foaming stability index (FSI). FCI means the capacity of a protein to make a foam under certain conditions (such as temperature, concentration, pH, whipping, etc.) due to air incorporation, whilst FSI is how effective a protein is in maintaining a foam during a fixed time [Gel-forming ability is the aggregation of unfolded proteins to form a 3D microstructure network through intermolecular interactions [Water vapour permeability (WVP) and tensile strength (TS) are the two critical parameters of film. The WVP of the film made from quinoa seeds, sesame seeds, and mung bean seeds were reported to be 1.98–4.76, 10.87–13.57, and 10.76 10In meat analogues processing, adding flavor (such as vanillin) and nutrients (such as flavonoids) is easy to achieve. Protein contains a variety of functional groups, which can interact with flavonoids, vanillin, quercetin, rutin, and other compounds through covalent (Schiff bases) and non-covalent (hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic force, etc.). Therefore, on one side, proteins can bond flavonoids and anthocyanins reversibly and irreversibly to form complexes and improve their stability. Jia et al. [Extrusion is the most widely used technology to process plant proteins to meat analogues with rich fibrous structures and good springiness like real animal meat. Specific mechanical energy (SME) and fibrous degree (FD) are the most important indicators of extruded meat analogues. SME refers to the mechanical energy absorbed per unit mass of extrudates, which translates into the extent of molecular collapse or disintegration of materials during extrusion. The FD was computed by dividing the crosswise shear force lengthways, which can be used for characterizing the anisotropic structure in the extrudate. Soy protein concentrate, pea protein isolate, and peanut protein powder have been used for extruding into meat analogues [']\n",

(The table presents detailed data on various plant-based starches, categorized under cereal seeds, tubers, roots, and green fruits. This extensive coverage provides a broad spectrum of starch characteristics, revealing differences in composition that depend on the plant variety or cultivar. The data in this table serve as a resource for understanding the starch characteristics of different plant-based foods*These value ranges are based on plant varieties and cultivars, such as normal or waxyMaize, also known as corn, is one of the most widely cultivated cereal crops globally. It is a staple food in many countries, particularly in regions including North and South America, Africa, and Asia. The quantity of starch in maize (corn) seeds can vary depending on factors such as the variety of maize, growing conditions, and maturity at harvest. However, maize seeds typically contain a significant amount of starch, as starch serves as the primary energy storage molecule in seeds. On average, maize seeds can contain around 60–75% starch by dry weight. This high starch content makes maize an important crop not only for human consumption but also for various industrial purposes, such as the production of cornstarch, corn syrup, and ethanol. The starch content in maize seeds makes it a valuable source of carbohydrates in human and animal diets, and it is used in a wide range of food products, including cornmeal, cornflakes, and tortillas, among others. Additionally, maize starch is utilized in non-food applications such as in the production of biodegradable plastics, adhesives, and textiles (Chen et al. Rice is another staple cereal crop consumed by a significant portion of the world's population, particularly in Asia. It is rich in starch, providing a readily available source of energy. The quantity of starch in rice seeds also varies depending on factors, including the rice variety, growing conditions, and maturity at harvest. Rice, like maize, serves as a major source of carbohydrates in many diets worldwide. Different varieties of rice, such as long grain, medium grain, and short grain, are used in diverse culinary preparations, including rice-based dishes, bread, noodles, yogurt, and desserts (Tiozon et al. Wheat is one of the oldest cultivated grains and a staple food in many parts of the world. It contains a substantial amount of starch, making it an important source of carbohydrates. On average, wheat grains can contain around 60–75% starch by dry weight. This high starch content makes wheat a valuable staple crop for human consumption and a key ingredient in various food products worldwide. Wheat starch is utilized in a wide range of food applications, including baking, pasta production, and the manufacturing of breakfast cereals, snacks, and confectionery items. Additionally, wheat starch is used in non-food industries such as papermaking, textiles, and pharmaceuticals (Baranzelli et al. Furthermore, sorghum grains contain a significant amount of starch, like other cereal grains, where it contains around 60–75% starch by dry weight, and this starch content makes sorghum an important staple crop for human consumption and a valuable feedstock for various industrial applications. Sorghum starch has several uses, including food and non-food applications. In food, sorghum starch is used in products such as sorghum flour, breakfast cereals, baked goods, and beverages. Sorghum is also a key ingredient in gluten-free products, providing an alternative for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. In non-food applications, sorghum starch finds use in industries such as papermaking, textiles, adhesives, and biofuel production. The versatility of sorghum starch makes it a valuable commodity in both agricultural and industrial sectors (Cruz et al. Cassava, a key crop in tropical regions, is renowned for its high starch content, serving as a crucial carbohydrate source globally. Cassava roots typically contain 60% to 80% starch by dry weight, ranking it among the richest starch sources in root crops. Predominantly composed of amylopectin, a branched polysaccharide, cassava starch contributes to its distinct culinary and industrial qualities. Its abundant starch makes cassava indispensable in various food items such as flour, starch, and tapioca pearls. Despite its low protein content, cassava provides essential nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making it significant in local diets. Furthermore, cassava starch finds applications in industries, including biofuel, adhesive, and biodegradable plastic production, as well as in food processing as a thickener, stabilizer, and texturizer. However, cassava contains toxic compounds, including cyanogenic glycosides, necessitating proper processing to eliminate cyanide. Failure to do so poses health risks, underscoring the importance of adhering to safe preparation methods (Akonor et al. Additionally, the starch content in potato tubers can vary depending on factors such as the potato variety, growing conditions, and storage conditions. Potatoes are known for their relatively high starch content compared to other tubers, which contain around 15–20% starch by fresh weight. However, this can vary significantly depending on the specific variety of potato and its stage of maturity. Starch content tends to increase as potatoes mature and reach full size. Starch serves as the primary carbohydrate reserve in potato tubers, providing energy for the plant during growth and serving as a storage compound for nutrients. Starch also contributes to the texture and culinary properties of potatoes, influencing characteristics such as texture, taste, and cooking behavior. Potatoes are a versatile crop with numerous culinary applications, and their starch content plays a significant role in their uses. Potatoes can be boiled, mashed, fried, roasted, or baked, and their starch content affects the final texture and consistency of the prepared dish (Juarez-Arellano et al. Sweet potatoes are known for their distinct flavor and nutritional benefits, and their starch content contributes to these characteristics. They are particularly popular in cuisines across Asia, Africa, and the Americas. On average, sweet potatoes have around 10–20% starch by fresh weight; however, the starch content in sweet potatoes can fluctuate depending on factors such as the specific variety and growing conditions. Generally, younger sweet potatoes tend to have a lower starch content, while more mature sweet potatoes may have higher levels of starch. Despite their name, sweet potatoes are not as high in starch as other starchy vegetables like regular potatoes. Instead, sweet potatoes are known for their high content of complex carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. The starch in sweet potatoes contributes to their texture and can affect cooking methods and outcomes. Due to their versatility and nutritional value, sweet potatoes are used in a variety of culinary applications, including roasting, baking, boiling, and mashing. The starch content of sweet potatoes influences their texture and sweetness, making them suitable for both savory and sweet dishes (Aina et al. Taro is a tropical root vegetable with a starchy corm that is widely consumed in Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. Taro possesses variable starch levels influenced by factors like variety, growth conditions, and maturity. Besides, taro boasts a substantial starch content that ranges from 60 to 90% by dry weight, where this significant concentration of starch enhances its nutritional profile and adaptability in cooking. Despite its starch richness, taro also offers a spectrum of essential nutrients such as dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, augmenting its value in balanced diets. Culinary-wise, taro's starch content accommodates diverse cooking techniques such as boiling, steaming, frying, or mashing, facilitating its integration into a wide array of global cuisines due to its creamy consistency and thickening properties for sauces and soups. Furthermore, beyond its culinary utility, taro's abundant starch finds application in industries like the production of biodegradable packaging, adhesives, and textiles, owing to\", \"array of global cuisines due to its creamy consistency and thickening properties for sauces and soups. Furthermore, beyond its culinary utility, taro's abundant starch finds application in industries like the production of biodegradable packaging, adhesives, and textiles, owing to its adhesive nature and eco-friendliness. Despite its nutritional and functional merits, individuals with specific dietary concerns, particularly those managing carbohydrate intake, should be cautious about taro's high starch content (Shanmathy et al. Plantains, a starchy fruit closely related to bananas, contain varying amounts of starch depending on factors such as ripeness and variety. When unripe, plantains have a higher starch content, typically ranging from 70 to 80% by dry weight, making them more suitable for cooking methods such as frying, boiling, or baking. As plantains ripen, their starch content decreases, and their sugar content increases, leading to sweeter flavors and softer textures. Ripe plantains contain less starch, usually around 20% to 30%, with a higher sugar content. This change in composition affects the culinary applications of plantains, with ripe plantains commonly used in sweet dishes, including desserts or fried as a snack. However, both ripe and unripe plantains offer nutritional benefits, including dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making them a valuable addition to diets in many cultures (Marta et al. To summarize, these starch-rich plant sources play crucial roles in global food security, providing sustenance and nourishment to diverse populations. They are valued not only for their nutritional content but also for their cultural significance and culinary versatility. Incorporating these plant-based staples into diets helps ensure contribute intake of essential nutrients and contributes to the promotion of sustainable and healthy eating habits.\"]\n",

       "'Accelerating relative sea-level rise (RSLR) threatens coastal wetlands globally, and their survival depends on the ability of wetlands to build soil vertically and maintain their elevation in the tidal frame. Studies using the Surface Elevation Table–Marker Horizon (SET-MH) method are advancing our understanding of the processes contributing to the sustainability of coastal wetland elevation in the face of rising sea levels, and their management implications, resulting in an approach that allows for comprehensive and systematic monitoring of wetland elevation change over a wide range of coastal environments globally. Collectively, the 27 articles in this special issue present an examination of current advances at quantifying and understanding subsurface process influences on wetland elevation change and wetland responses to sea-level rise, drawing on research presentations from two special sessions at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) 2021 conference plus additional recent research describing scientific insights gained from the SET-MH method. These insights include information from research on the five thematic topics presented below. This special issue should be of great value to everyone interested in the latest advances in coastal wetland elevation dynamics using the SET-MH technique.A 30-year retrospective on the scientific insights gained on the surface and shallow subsurface processes influencing wetland elevation dynamics using the SET-MH method, including fundamental revelations about tidal wetland elevation dynamics.The development and evolution of the SET-MH technique has led to the recognition that coastal wetland soil elevation dynamics are driven by complex interactions among surface and subsurface processes (Cahoon Investigations of the subsurface soil process influences on wetland elevation\\xa0(e.g., Maher and Starke Essential plant nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are often in limited supply in tidal wetlands, thereby restricting plant growth and soil organic matter accumulation influences on elevation gain. Nutrient enrichment in oligotrophic wetlands from sediment addition, nutrient pollution, or fertilization can lead to increased plant growth, soil organic matter accumulation, and wetland elevation gain (see\\xa0Table\\xa03 in Cahoon How the scientific community applies the SET–MH method to quantify and understand wetland responses to RSLR and other environmental drivers such as altered hydrology and sediment supply, changes in plant production, and management and restoration actions through statistical analyses of changes in surface elevation, and how the information gained can be used to inform management decisions.Wetland elevation trend responses to RSLR are shown to vary by lateral position within the estuary for salt marshes (e.g., riverine, bayside, and barrier island settings; Steinmuller et al. How SET-MH data are used in long-term monitoring networks at different geographic scales where the distance among network sites ranges from local (i.e., 10\\xa0s of kilometers) to regional (i.e., 100\\xa0s of kilometers) to national (i.e., 1000\\xa0s of kilometers), and what complementary datasets will enhance comparisons to environmental drivers such as RSLR.Local networks are used to assess environmental gradients in a coastal sound or bay, such as distance from a sediment source (e.g., ocean inlet (Roman et al. Multidecadal datasets from regional networks in the USA covering multiple sounds and bays in California (Thorne et al. A national network of 289 SET-MH stations spanning a range of tidal wetland types across mainland Australian coastal states and territories (Saintilan et al. Pairing the SET-MH method with survey techniques to increase lateral coverage of wetland elevation trends and with geodetic techniques to increase vertical coverage of vertical land motion, including both shallow and deep subsidence, thereby improving our understanding of coastal wetland elevation dynamics and responses to RSLR.An individual rod SET station measures elevation across an approximate 1.5 mWhen comparing a SET wetland elevation trend to a nearby tide gauge RSLR trend, the underlying assumption is that deep subsidence rates are the same beneath both the wetland and the tide station (Cahoon '"

       " 'text': 'Accelerating relative sea-level rise (RSLR) threatens coastal wetlands globally, and their survival depends on the ability of wetlands to build soil vertically and maintain their elevation in the tidal frame. Studies using the Surface Elevation Table–Marker Horizon (SET-MH) method are advancing our understanding of the processes contributing to the sustainability of coastal wetland elevation in the face of rising sea levels, and their management implications, resulting in an approach that allows for comprehensive and systematic monitoring of wetland elevation change over a wide range of coastal environments globally. Collectively, the 27 articles in this special issue present an examination of current advances at quantifying and understanding subsurface process influences on wetland elevation change and wetland responses to sea-level rise, drawing on research presentations from two special sessions at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) 2021 conference plus additional recent research describing scientific insights gained from the SET-MH method. These insights include information from research on the five thematic topics presented below. This special issue should be of great value to everyone interested in the latest advances in coastal wetland elevation dynamics using the SET-MH technique.A 30-year retrospective on the scientific insights gained on the surface and shallow subsurface processes influencing wetland elevation dynamics using the SET-MH method, including fundamental revelations about tidal wetland elevation dynamics.The development and evolution of the SET-MH technique has led to the recognition that coastal wetland soil elevation dynamics are driven by complex interactions among surface and subsurface processes (Cahoon Investigations of the subsurface soil process influences on wetland elevation\\xa0(e.g., Maher and Starke Essential plant nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are often in limited supply in tidal wetlands, thereby restricting plant growth and soil organic matter accumulation influences on elevation gain. Nutrient enrichment in oligotrophic wetlands from sediment addition, nutrient pollution, or fertilization can lead to increased plant growth, soil organic matter accumulation, and wetland elevation gain (see\\xa0Table\\xa03 in Cahoon How the scientific community applies the SET–MH method to quantify and understand wetland responses to RSLR and other environmental drivers such as altered hydrology and sediment supply, changes in plant production, and management and restoration actions through statistical analyses of changes in surface elevation, and how the information gained can be used to inform management decisions.Wetland elevation trend responses to RSLR are shown to vary by lateral position within the estuary for salt marshes (e.g., riverine, bayside, and barrier island settings; Steinmuller et al. How SET-MH data are used in long-term monitoring networks at different geographic scales where the distance among network sites ranges from local (i.e., 10\\xa0s of kilometers) to regional (i.e., 100\\xa0s of kilometers) to national (i.e., 1000\\xa0s of kilometers), and what complementary datasets will enhance comparisons to environmental drivers such as RSLR.Local networks are used to assess environmental gradients in a coastal sound or bay, such as distance from a sediment source (e.g., ocean inlet (Roman et al. Multidecadal datasets from regional networks in the USA covering multiple sounds and bays in California (Thorne et al. A national network of 289 SET-MH stations spanning a range of tidal wetland types across mainland Australian coastal states and territories (Saintilan et al. Pairing the SET-MH method with survey techniques to increase lateral coverage of wetland elevation trends and with geodetic techniques to increase vertical coverage of vertical land motion, including both shallow and deep subsidence, thereby improving our understanding of coastal wetland elevation dynamics and responses to RSLR.An individual rod SET station measures elevation across an approximate 1.5 mWhen comparing a SET wetland elevation trend to a nearby tide gauge RSLR trend, the underlying assumption is that deep subsidence rates are the same beneath both the wetland and the tide station (Cahoon',\n",

       "   'p': 'A network of 15 Surface Elevation Tables (SETs) at North Inlet estuary, South Carolina, has been monitored on annual or monthly time scales beginning from 1990 to 1996 and continuing through 2022. Of 73 time series in control plots, 12 had elevation gains equal to or exceeding the local rate of sea-level rise (SLR, 0.34\\xa0cm/year). Rising marsh elevation in North Inlet is dominated by organic production and, we hypothesize, is proportional to net ecosystem production. The rate of elevation gain was 0.47\\xa0cm/year in plots experimentally fertilized for 10\\xa0years with N&P compared to nearby control plots that have gained 0.1\\xa0cm/year in 26\\xa0years. The excess gains and losses of elevation in fertilized plots were accounted for by changes in belowground biomass and turnover. This is supported by bioassay experiments in marsh organs where at age 2 the belowground biomass of fertilized S. alterniflora plants was increasing by 1,994\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2\\xa0year^−1, which added a growth premium of 2.4\\xa0cm/year to elevation gain. This was contrasted with the net belowground growth of 746\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2\\xa0year^−1 in controls, which can add 0.89\\xa0cm/year to elevation. Root biomass density was greater in the fertilized bioassay treatments than in controls, plateauing at about 1,374\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 and 472\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2, respectively. Growth of belowground biomass was dominated by rhizomes, which grew to 3,648\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 in the fertilized treatments after 3\\xa0years and 1,439\\xa0g\\xa0m^−2 in the control treatments after 5\\xa0years. Depositional wetlands are limited by an exogenous supply of mineral sediment, whereas marshes like North Inlet could be classified as autonomous because they depend on in situ organic production to maintain elevation. Autonomous wetlands are more vulnerable to SLR because their elevation gains are constrained ultimately by photosynthetic efficiency.'},\n",
