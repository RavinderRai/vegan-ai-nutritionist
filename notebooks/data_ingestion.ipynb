    "This project is about creating an AI vegan nutrition advisor. Here we explore and experiment with APIs to collect our context data, from which we will ultimately implement a RAG solution with. We use the Springer API to get research papers and articles on veganism - this is the most freely accessible API for this kind of work - some others like PubMed are good but require a subscription. The docs can be found here: https://docs-dev.springernature.com/docs/#api-endpoints/api-endpoints."

This viewpoint suggests that there are exciting prospects to reformulate meat products that are produced more sustainably and may also have health benefits by substituting high-protein nonmeat ingredients for some of the meat. Considering these pre-existing conditions, this review critically reviews recent data on extenders from several sources, including pulses, plant-based components, plant byproducts, and unconventional sources. We used the related keywords from Scopus-database without limiting the publishing date. With an emphasis on how these findings may impact the sustainability of meat products, it sees them as a great chance to enhance the functional quality and technological profile of meat. Therefore, to promote sustainability, meat alternatives such as plant-based meat equivalents are being made available. To boost consumer acceptability of these goods, further initiatives should also be developed to enhance the functioning of these innovative food items and increase public knowledge of plant-based meat analogues.'}},\n",

Vitamin status can be affected by diet, supplements, kidney function, medications, and dialysis. Little is known about vitamin requirements in CKD, leading to practice variation. The Pediatric Renal Nutrition Taskforce (PRNT), an international team of pediatric kidney dietitians and pediatric nephrologists, was established to develop evidence-based clinical practice points (CPPs) to address challenges and to serve as a resource for nutritional care. Questions were formulated using PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes), and literature searches undertaken to explore clinical practice from assessment to management of vitamin status in children with CKD stages 2–5, on dialysis and post-transplantation (CKD2-5D&T). The CPPs were developed and finalized using a Delphi consensus approach. We present six CPPs for vitamin management for children with CKD2-5D&T. We address assessment, intervention, and monitoring. We recommend avoiding supplementation of vitamin A and suggest water-soluble vitamin supplementation for those on dialysis. In the absence of evidence, a consistent structured approach to vitamin management that considers assessment and monitoring from dietary, physical, and biochemical viewpoints is needed. Careful consideration of the impact of accumulation, losses, comorbidities, and medications needs to be explored for the individual child and vitamin before supplementation can be considered. When supplementing, care needs to be taken not to over-prescribe. Research recommendations are suggested.'}},\n",

       "   'p': 'This study aimed to investigate the impact of varying proportions of dry bean powder on the rheological properties of oil-in-water emulsions. Emulsions were formulated utilizing xanthan gum or dry bean powder across a range of concentrations, including 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Additionally, a control emulsion (CTR) was formulated using xanthan gum exclusively. The rheological properties of the resulting emulsions, both linear and nonlinear, were characterized. Moreover, the correlation between microstructural attributes and the interfacial rheological response within these emulsion systems was thoroughly examined. A prominent observation was the occurrence of shear thinning, characterized by a reduction in viscosity under applied shear stress. Notably, the control emulsion (CTR) displayed the lowest interfacial viscosity values, whereas emulsions incorporating increasing proportions of dry bean powder demonstrated a proportional rise in interfacial viscosity. The highest consistency coefficient and apparent viscosity was recorded in the 7%DB sample with a value of 3.23\\xa0Pa.sn and 0.56\\xa0Pa.s, respectively. This suggests that emulsions formulated with dry bean powder may yield a more resilient interfacial film, attributed to the protein content inherent in dry beans. The establishment of a viscoelastic interfacial layer facilitated by dry bean powder in appropriate concentrations significantly contributes to the long-term stability of the emulsion. Unraveling the intricate relationship between interfacial behaviors holds paramount importance in advocating for the utilization of dry bean powder as a plant-based protein source. In conclusion, the incorporation of dry bean powder enhances the formation of interfacial films in O/W emulsions.'}},\n",

How these parasites are able to replicate and avoid apoptosis is not known. Dual RNA-sequencing transcriptomes of infected nuclei isolated using laser-capture microdissection revealed that ‘ Candidatus Endonucleobacter’ does not obtain most of its nutrition from nuclear DNA or RNA. Instead, ‘ Candidatus Endonucleobacter’ upregulates genes for importing and digesting sugars, lipids, amino acids and possibly mucin from its host. It likely prevents apoptosis of host cells by upregulating 7–13 inhibitors of apoptosis, proteins not previously seen in bacteria. Comparative phylogenetic analyses revealed that ‘ Ca .

Untargeted metabolomics was used to study breast milk from 31 healthy participants to assess the shared metabolites in milk from participants with various backgrounds and understand how different demographic, health, and environmental factors impact the milk metabolome. Breast milk samples were analyzed by four separate UPLC-MS/MS methods. Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis was used to study the most and least variable metabolites. The associations between participant factors and the metabolome were assessed with redundancy analyses. Among all 31 participants and between each untargeted UPLC-MS/MS method, 731 metabolites were detected, of which 389 were shared among all participants. Of the shared metabolites, lactose was the least and lactobionate the most variable metabolite. In the biological super pathway analysis, xenobiotics were the most variable metabolites. Infant age, maternal age, number of live births, and pre-pregnancy BMI were associated with the milk metabolome. In conclusion, the most variable metabolites originate from environmental exposures while the well-conserved core metabolites are linked to cell metabolism or are crucial for infant nutrition and osmoregulation.

Policies largely fail to connect the topic of immigrant labour with goals like shortening supply chains, subject immigrant neighbourhoods to stigmatizing health discourses, and lack acknowledgement of the barriers immigrants may face to participating in sustainable food systems. Relatedly, policy discourses articulate forms of food citizenship that emphasize individual obligations over rights related to food. This jeopardizes the potential for immigrants to be seen as belonging to dominant political urban food communities and benefitting from the symbolic and material rewards associated with them.'}},\n",

However, plastisphere mycobiome, particularly in terrestrial environments, remains largely unexplored. We conducted a comparative analysis of soil and plastisphere fungal communities using 125 experimental microcosms. Our results revealed distinct taxonomic structures between these two environments, with the genera Penicillium and pathogenic Alternaria being specifically enriched in the plastisphere. In comparison with soil communities, plastisphere communities exhibited weaker associations with environmental variables. Stochastic processes were found to be primary drivers of plastisphere fungal community assembly. Limited dispersal of fungal communities on soil microplastics was obtained, suggesting potential implications for taxa isolation or even diversity loss. The expanding plastisphere would pose critical planetary ecology challenges. Our findings highlight plastisphere act as unique niches for fungal communities that are less influenced by environmental variables, providing new insights into the ecology of the soil plastisphere.',\n",

This viewpoint suggests that there are exciting prospects to reformulate meat products that are produced more sustainably and may also have health benefits by substituting high-protein nonmeat ingredients for some of the meat. Considering these pre-existing conditions, this review critically reviews recent data on extenders from several sources, including pulses, plant-based components, plant byproducts, and unconventional sources. We used the related keywords from Scopus-database without limiting the publishing date. With an emphasis on how these findings may impact the sustainability of meat products, it sees them as a great chance to enhance the functional quality and technological profile of meat. Therefore, to promote sustainability, meat alternatives such as plant-based meat equivalents are being made available. To boost consumer acceptability of these goods, further initiatives should also be developed to enhance the functioning of these innovative food items and increase public knowledge of plant-based meat analogues.'}},\n",

       "   'p': 'The artificial pulsed-flows impact associated with hydropower production on the downstream biological and physical processes has been extensively addressed, showing that it may cause fish drift while changing fish habitat selection toward lower water velocity patches, acting as refuge areas. We aimed to evaluate the attraction efficiency of two flow-refuges differing in their approaching angles, for Luciobarbus bocagei at an indoor experimental flume. We tested two flow-refuge insertion angles (45° and 70°), and two flow events (base 7\\xa0L/s and pulsed-flow 60\\xa0L/s) for each. To analyze flow-refuge efficiency, we quantified fish individual and group patterns, flow-refuge use, and permanence time, while measuring glucose and lactate responses. The results showed that the individual frequency of use during simulated pulsed-flow was higher, especially on the 45° flow-refuge. The simulated pulsed-flow condition did not disrupt group behavior for both approaching angles. Glucose and lactate analysis did not trigger physiological responses in the tested trials. The 45° flow-refuge was used more often than the 70°. The narrowing of the channel caused by the 45° flow-refuge, and the consequent higher flow homogeneity increased the attractiveness of the flow-refuge. Therefore, the flow-refuge insertion angle should be a decisive criterion in the construction and installation of flow-refuges for cyprinids, and be considered a potential indirect mitigation measure.'}}]"

Among all the cereal proteins, wheat gluten is extensively used due to its low cost and excellent viscoelastic properties which makes it suitable to bind flavour, color, and other ingredients that result in the making of excellent meat analogues [Besides all the above-discussed proteins, several other types of proteins are there such as—corn zein protein, peanuts, potato proteins, pumpkin, etc. can be used in the development of PBMA.

Generally, meat analogues are developed from defatted protein sources that result in lesser fat content in the meat analogues. Therefore to increase the fat content minimally fractionated soy that contains higher fat is used in the manufacturing of fibrous structures like meat analogues [In meat analogues, different flavour generation components and their critical interaction during processing have a crucial role in mimicking specific meat-like tastes and flavors. Meat analogue's taste and flavour predominate its acceptance as a meat alternative to the consumer. Uses of different spices, seasonings, herbs, sugars, salts, and savoury aromas, and their binding capacity to the plant proteins through the extrusion process are directly responsible for meat-like flavour generation [In the consumer's opinion, color is the most important parameter to create a visual appeal for meat analogues in their mind. Each meat has some specific color that changes through different processes such as cooking and smoking. Similarly, meat analogues should have meat mimic color and color change characteristics during processing. Several heat colorings agents such as malt or annatto, turmin, leghemoglobin, erythrosine, cumin, caramel colors, carotene, canthaxanthin, and lycopene have been used to incorporate the meat color and color change characteristics in the meat analogues [Meat analogues are made by combining a variety of ingredients through different texturizing techniques. For optimum binding of all the necessary ingredients (flavor, color, stabilizers, emulsifier, thickeners) several binding and texturing agents such as different natural gums (xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum), carrageenan, hydrocolloids (methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), wheat gluten, soy protein concentrate, casein are used [In meat analogues, water is a multi-functional ingredient, primarily from providing a hydration effect to the critical conformational change in protein water plays a crucial part in the designing of PBMA. In the extrusion process, high moisture content promotes greater hydrophobic interaction and the creation of disulfide bonds, and H-bonds [Nowadays PBMA is gaining attention worldwide.

       "  'body': 'Finely chopped meat from various materials (such as hog, beef, mutton, etc.) is utilized in animal-based emulsion-type goods to create a steady blend, which links water and holds fat, offering the dish its distinctive texture when heated [Soy protein, gluten, pea proteins, and potato proteins are among the plant proteins that can hold water and stabilize emulsions and gels. There is also the option of including proteins in a texturized state to generate a rougher texture in formulations of the emulsion type. However, non-protein binders or fillers like polysaccharides are frequently added to proteins (e.g., fibres and starches). It is widely recognized that the occurrence of plant proteins frequently results in a decrease in gel formation/elasticity in cooked emulsion goods, which is where the inclusion of those components comes from [Fat is an important ingredient because it enhances the juiciness, softness, and as whole mouthfeel of emulsion-type products. Moisture and fat binding must be stable in the highly hydrated gel protein matrix. For meat products, rind emulsions or fat pre-emulsions are employed to stabilize the fat, avoiding fat departure while cooking and agglomerate of the fat on the product\\'s surface. Equivalent expectations are anticipated for plant-based contemporaries that employ plant oils and fats. For finely ground sausage applications such as\\xa0frankfurters, the kind of fat (meaning less or large melting temperature) appears to be less significant, but fats with greater melting points are employed for making cooked coarse-cutting sausages or emulsion-type products with fat additions such as\\xa0mortadella [To make the product mimic meat emulsion-type goods, colourants and spices are also included. Colors that are heat stable are employed, although they can also be naturalistic. For instance, to give plant-based bologna compositions (Smart Deli® Bologna by Lightlife) a traditional pink colour, paprika oleoresins and fermented rice flour were utilized. Depending on the kind of product the meat analogue imitates, a range of natural savoury spices and meaty scents are accessible [The goal of plant-based meat alternates that look like ground and bound meat from animals is to replicate its distinctive bite, chewiness, succulence, and firmness. Burgers, patties, and nuggets made from animal products mostly contain proteins and lipids with little amounts of seasoning, salt, and binders (for example, wheat crumbs, starches, and fibers). While binders help retain water and fat and enhance the texture and look of the product, salt alters the structure of proteins and toughens products (albeit in lesser quantities) [Frequently, low moisture extrusion heating is used to texturize the protein. The soy, wheat, or pea protein-based TVPs, as well as their combinations, are the most often utilized TVPs in meat analogues. However, there are more and more protein sources that can be texturized and may be employed in the creation of novel plant-based burger-like products. In the final product formulation, hydrated TVP adds the desired juiciness and gives the product a meaty, chewy texture. The capacity of novel protein sources to maintain water in the storage period and free it during cooking and distortion are the main topics of research. Nonetheless, just like ground beef, TVP cannot be used alone to create a cohesive product, necessitating the usage of binders.The major contenders in commercial products are egg protein and methylcellulose, although wheat gluten can also fill this character because it forms a network when wet and aids in binding TVP and other components. Texturizers that have a high water-holding capacity and can make the burger softer and juicier are used to further enhance the texture and mouthfeel of the items. Protein concentrates, protein isolates, and polysaccharides can all be employed to meet the latter ingredient needs. The product\\'s fat, which can be a free, emulsified, liquid or solid plant-based fat, affects the feeling of juiciness as well. To attain the ideal balance, liquid fats (like coconut or palm oil) and solid fats (like sunflower and canola oil) are frequently combined (for example, see the Beyond Burger® and the Impossible TM Burger). Ideal burger fats should be liquid when heated and solid at room temperature. As a result, the food has a satisfying mouthfeel like that of related meat products.Additionally, \"bleeding\" vegetarian burgers use beetroot juice to impart a recognizable meat hue while also attempting to impart a sense of juiciness. By creating new color-changing substances, flavourings, and fragrance precursors, research and development on plant-based burgers are also concentrated on obtaining even higher juiciness and enhancing the look and flavour of these goods.The imitation of whole-cut meats like chicken, pork, and beef steak, which are distinguished by the occurrence of long fibres or layered structures, is the goal of another category of meat analogue goods. Extrusion is used to create plant-based products that imitate this fibrous or layered structure. To obtain the desired final structure, colour, softness, aroma, and taste change, the items are treated more by freezing, curing, marinating, and cooking. Shear cell technology, which is currently being developed, has the prospective to produce big fragments of fibrous plant-based goods, whereas extrusion can currently only be used to produce small portions of similar products [Concentrates and other fewer refined formulas of soy protein, in addition to isolated soy protein, are employed in extrusion applications [Contingent on whether the result simulates raw or cooked meat, colouring agents and flavours (comprising salt) can either be incorporated in the structuring process or administered as a marinade later. Most applications for flavour addition rely on marination since flavour components are harmed by the conditions utilized in an extruder. According to a patent by Giezen et al. [The addition of ginger, papain, and their mixture to camel meat burger patties during formulation led to a considerable rise in the collagen solubility and sensory scores of juiciness, tenderness, overall acceptability, and a significant reduction of the shear force values.

       "  'body': \"Finely chopped meat from various materials (such as hog, beef, mutton, etc.) is utilized in animal-based emulsion-type goods to create a steady blend, which links water and holds fat, offering the dish its distinctive texture when heated [Soy protein, gluten, pea proteins, and potato proteins are among the plant proteins that can hold water and stabilize emulsions and gels. There is also the option of including proteins in a texturized state to generate a rougher texture in formulations of the emulsion type. However, non-protein binders or fillers like polysaccharides are frequently added to proteins (e.g., fibres and starches). It is widely recognized that the occurrence of plant proteins frequently results in a decrease in gel formation/elasticity in cooked emulsion goods, which is where the inclusion of those components comes from [Fat is an important ingredient because it enhances the juiciness, softness, and as whole mouthfeel of emulsion-type products. Moisture and fat binding must be stable in the highly hydrated gel protein matrix. For meat products, rind emulsions or fat pre-emulsions are employed to stabilize the fat, avoiding fat departure while cooking and agglomerate of the fat on the product's surface. Equivalent expectations are anticipated for plant-based contemporaries that employ plant oils and fats. For finely ground sausage applications such as\\xa0frankfurters, the kind of fat (meaning less or large melting temperature) appears to be less significant, but fats with greater melting points are employed for making cooked coarse-cutting sausages or emulsion-type products with fat additions such as\\xa0mortadella [To make the product mimic meat emulsion-type goods, colourants and spices are also included. Colors that are heat stable are employed, although they can also be naturalistic. For instance, to give plant-based bologna compositions (Smart Deli® Bologna by Lightlife) a traditional pink colour, paprika oleoresins and fermented rice flour were utilized. Depending on the kind of product the meat analogue imitates, a range of natural savoury spices and meaty scents are accessible [\"},\n",

       "  'body': 'The goal of plant-based meat alternates that look like ground and bound meat from animals is to replicate its distinctive bite, chewiness, succulence, and firmness. Burgers, patties, and nuggets made from animal products mostly contain proteins and lipids with little amounts of seasoning, salt, and binders (for example, wheat crumbs, starches, and fibers). While binders help retain water and fat and enhance the texture and look of the product, salt alters the structure of proteins and toughens products (albeit in lesser quantities) [Frequently, low moisture extrusion heating is used to texturize the protein. The soy, wheat, or pea protein-based TVPs, as well as their combinations, are the most often utilized TVPs in meat analogues. However, there are more and more protein sources that can be texturized and may be employed in the creation of novel plant-based burger-like products. In the final product formulation, hydrated TVP adds the desired juiciness and gives the product a meaty, chewy texture. The capacity of novel protein sources to maintain water in the storage period and free it during cooking and distortion are the main topics of research. Nonetheless, just like ground beef, TVP cannot be used alone to create a cohesive product, necessitating the usage of binders.The major contenders in commercial products are egg protein and methylcellulose, although wheat gluten can also fill this character because it forms a network when wet and aids in binding TVP and other components. Texturizers that have a high water-holding capacity and can make the burger softer and juicier are used to further enhance the texture and mouthfeel of the items. Protein concentrates, protein isolates, and polysaccharides can all be employed to meet the latter ingredient needs. The product\\'s fat, which can be a free, emulsified, liquid or solid plant-based fat, affects the feeling of juiciness as well. To attain the ideal balance, liquid fats (like coconut or palm oil) and solid fats (like sunflower and canola oil) are frequently combined (for example, see the Beyond Burger® and the Impossible TM Burger). Ideal burger fats should be liquid when heated and solid at room temperature. As a result, the food has a satisfying mouthfeel like that of related meat products.Additionally, \"bleeding\" vegetarian burgers use beetroot juice to impart a recognizable meat hue while also attempting to impart a sense of juiciness. By creating new color-changing substances, flavourings, and fragrance precursors, research and development on plant-based burgers are also concentrated on obtaining even higher juiciness and enhancing the look and flavour of these goods.'},\n",

Extrusion is used to create plant-based products that imitate this fibrous or layered structure. To obtain the desired final structure, colour, softness, aroma, and taste change, the items are treated more by freezing, curing, marinating, and cooking. Shear cell technology, which is currently being developed, has the prospective to produce big fragments of fibrous plant-based goods, whereas extrusion can currently only be used to produce small portions of similar products [Concentrates and other fewer refined formulas of soy protein, in addition to isolated soy protein, are employed in extrusion applications [Contingent on whether the result simulates raw or cooked meat, colouring agents and flavours (comprising salt) can either be incorporated in the structuring process or administered as a marinade later.

       "  'body': 'The subject of plant-based meat analogues has been the primary topic of conversation in the food area for quite some time because of expanded concern connected with the well-being influences and supportable advancement of meat choices. People may be more willing to substitute their meat consumption by creating meat analogues, which copy meat with both its nutritional content and its physical sensations. As a result, understanding the study findings on the creation, enhancement, requirement, sustainability, and usefulness of meat analogues is critical in developing a plan for future research in this sector. As a result, this review provides a thorough discussion of the importance of developing meat analogues, the health risks associated with producing meat products, the sources of plant proteins that can be used to develop meat analogues, the functionality of the ingredients used to develop these products, and consumer attitudes towards plant-based meat alternatives. The purpose is to assess the present status of scientific research on PBMA and estimate future research opportunities. Product development is difficult due to the wide range of ingredient functionality requirements across the many forms of plant-based meat substitutes (sausages, burgers, and meatballs). In general, meat analogue applications do not benefit from the functional properties of readily available protein-rich ingredients, the majority of which are highly purified from plant material. The need to use additives to improve product textures is critical. As a result, prospective research must be done to update the functioning of these novel food products and boost public knowledge of plant-based meat substitutes to increase consumer acceptance. Other fractionation techniques, which prioritize functionality over purity, can produce novel functionality. Additionally, novel proteins can provide novel ingredients for meat analog applications.'}]"

Generally, meat analogues are developed from defatted protein sources that result in lesser fat content in the meat analogues. Therefore to increase the fat content minimally fractionated soy that contains higher fat is used in the manufacturing of fibrous structures like meat analogues [In meat analogues, different flavour generation components and their critical interaction during processing have a crucial role in mimicking specific meat-like tastes and flavors. Meat analogue's taste and flavour predominate its acceptance as a meat alternative to the consumer. Uses of different spices, seasonings, herbs, sugars, salts, and savoury aromas, and their binding capacity to the plant proteins through the extrusion process are directly responsible for meat-like flavour generation [In the consumer's opinion, color is the most important parameter to create a visual appeal for meat analogues in their mind. Each meat has some specific color that changes through different processes such as cooking and smoking. Similarly, meat analogues should have meat mimic color and color change characteristics during processing. Several heat colorings agents such as malt or annatto, turmin, leghemoglobin, erythrosine, cumin, caramel colors, carotene, canthaxanthin, and lycopene have been used to incorporate the meat color and color change characteristics in the meat analogues [Meat analogues are made by combining a variety of ingredients through different texturizing techniques. For optimum binding of all the necessary ingredients (flavor, color, stabilizers, emulsifier, thickeners) several binding and texturing agents such as different natural gums (xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum), carrageenan, hydrocolloids (methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), wheat gluten, soy protein concentrate, casein are used [In meat analogues, water is a multi-functional ingredient, primarily from providing a hydration effect to the critical conformational change in protein water plays a crucial part in the designing of PBMA.

       "   'body': 'Finely chopped meat from various materials (such as hog, beef, mutton, etc.) is utilized in animal-based emulsion-type goods to create a steady blend, which links water and holds fat, offering the dish its distinctive texture when heated [Soy protein, gluten, pea proteins, and potato proteins are among the plant proteins that can hold water and stabilize emulsions and gels. There is also the option of including proteins in a texturized state to generate a rougher texture in formulations of the emulsion type. However, non-protein binders or fillers like polysaccharides are frequently added to proteins (e.g., fibres and starches). It is widely recognized that the occurrence of plant proteins frequently results in a decrease in gel formation/elasticity in cooked emulsion goods, which is where the inclusion of those components comes from [Fat is an important ingredient because it enhances the juiciness, softness, and as whole mouthfeel of emulsion-type products. Moisture and fat binding must be stable in the highly hydrated gel protein matrix. For meat products, rind emulsions or fat pre-emulsions are employed to stabilize the fat, avoiding fat departure while cooking and agglomerate of the fat on the product\\'s surface. Equivalent expectations are anticipated for plant-based contemporaries that employ plant oils and fats. For finely ground sausage applications such as\\xa0frankfurters, the kind of fat (meaning less or large melting temperature) appears to be less significant, but fats with greater melting points are employed for making cooked coarse-cutting sausages or emulsion-type products with fat additions such as\\xa0mortadella [To make the product mimic meat emulsion-type goods, colourants and spices are also included. Colors that are heat stable are employed, although they can also be naturalistic. For instance, to give plant-based bologna compositions (Smart Deli® Bologna by Lightlife) a traditional pink colour, paprika oleoresins and fermented rice flour were utilized. Depending on the kind of product the meat analogue imitates, a range of natural savoury spices and meaty scents are accessible [The goal of plant-based meat alternates that look like ground and bound meat from animals is to replicate its distinctive bite, chewiness, succulence, and firmness. Burgers, patties, and nuggets made from animal products mostly contain proteins and lipids with little amounts of seasoning, salt, and binders (for example, wheat crumbs, starches, and fibers). While binders help retain water and fat and enhance the texture and look of the product, salt alters the structure of proteins and toughens products (albeit in lesser quantities) [Frequently, low moisture extrusion heating is used to texturize the protein. The soy, wheat, or pea protein-based TVPs, as well as their combinations, are the most often utilized TVPs in meat analogues. However, there are more and more protein sources that can be texturized and may be employed in the creation of novel plant-based burger-like products. In the final product formulation, hydrated TVP adds the desired juiciness and gives the product a meaty, chewy texture. The capacity of novel protein sources to maintain water in the storage period and free it during cooking and distortion are the main topics of research. Nonetheless, just like ground beef, TVP cannot be used alone to create a cohesive product, necessitating the usage of binders.The major contenders in commercial products are egg protein and methylcellulose, although wheat gluten can also fill this character because it forms a network when wet and aids in binding TVP and other components. Texturizers that have a high water-holding capacity and can make the burger softer and juicier are used to further enhance the texture and mouthfeel of the items. Protein concentrates, protein isolates, and polysaccharides can all be employed to meet the latter ingredient needs. The product\\'s fat, which can be a free, emulsified, liquid or solid plant-based fat, affects the feeling of juiciness as well. To attain the ideal balance, liquid fats (like coconut or palm oil) and solid fats (like sunflower and canola oil) are frequently combined (for example, see the Beyond Burger® and the Impossible TM Burger). Ideal burger fats should be liquid when heated and solid at room temperature. As a result, the food has a satisfying mouthfeel like that of related meat products.Additionally, \"bleeding\" vegetarian burgers use beetroot juice to impart a recognizable meat hue while also attempting to impart a sense of juiciness. By creating new color-changing substances, flavourings, and fragrance precursors, research and development on plant-based burgers are also concentrated on obtaining even higher juiciness and enhancing the look and flavour of these goods.The imitation of whole-cut meats like chicken, pork, and beef steak, which are distinguished by the occurrence of long fibres or layered structures, is the goal of another category of meat analogue goods. Extrusion is used to create plant-based products that imitate this fibrous or layered structure. To obtain the desired final structure, colour, softness, aroma, and taste change, the items are treated more by freezing, curing, marinating, and cooking. Shear cell technology, which is currently being developed, has the prospective to produce big fragments of fibrous plant-based goods, whereas extrusion can currently only be used to produce small portions of similar products [Concentrates and other fewer refined formulas of soy protein, in addition to isolated soy protein, are employed in extrusion applications [Contingent on whether the result simulates raw or cooked meat, colouring agents and flavours (comprising salt) can either be incorporated in the structuring process or administered as a marinade later. Most applications for flavour addition rely on marination since flavour components are harmed by the conditions utilized in an extruder. According to a patent by Giezen et al.

       "   'body': \"Finely chopped meat from various materials (such as hog, beef, mutton, etc.) is utilized in animal-based emulsion-type goods to create a steady blend, which links water and holds fat, offering the dish its distinctive texture when heated [Soy protein, gluten, pea proteins, and potato proteins are among the plant proteins that can hold water and stabilize emulsions and gels. There is also the option of including proteins in a texturized state to generate a rougher texture in formulations of the emulsion type. However, non-protein binders or fillers like polysaccharides are frequently added to proteins (e.g., fibres and starches). It is widely recognized that the occurrence of plant proteins frequently results in a decrease in gel formation/elasticity in cooked emulsion goods, which is where the inclusion of those components comes from [Fat is an important ingredient because it enhances the juiciness, softness, and as whole mouthfeel of emulsion-type products. Moisture and fat binding must be stable in the highly hydrated gel protein matrix. For meat products, rind emulsions or fat pre-emulsions are employed to stabilize the fat, avoiding fat departure while cooking and agglomerate of the fat on the product's surface. Equivalent expectations are anticipated for plant-based contemporaries that employ plant oils and fats. For finely ground sausage applications such as\\xa0frankfurters, the kind of fat (meaning less or large melting temperature) appears to be less significant, but fats with greater melting points are employed for making cooked coarse-cutting sausages or emulsion-type products with fat additions such as\\xa0mortadella [To make the product mimic meat emulsion-type goods, colourants and spices are also included. Colors that are heat stable are employed, although they can also be naturalistic. For instance, to give plant-based bologna compositions (Smart Deli® Bologna by Lightlife) a traditional pink colour, paprika oleoresins and fermented rice flour were utilized. Depending on the kind of product the meat analogue imitates, a range of natural savoury spices and meaty scents are accessible [\"},\n",

       "   'body': 'The goal of plant-based meat alternates that look like ground and bound meat from animals is to replicate its distinctive bite, chewiness, succulence, and firmness. Burgers, patties, and nuggets made from animal products mostly contain proteins and lipids with little amounts of seasoning, salt, and binders (for example, wheat crumbs, starches, and fibers). While binders help retain water and fat and enhance the texture and look of the product, salt alters the structure of proteins and toughens products (albeit in lesser quantities) [Frequently, low moisture extrusion heating is used to texturize the protein. The soy, wheat, or pea protein-based TVPs, as well as their combinations, are the most often utilized TVPs in meat analogues. However, there are more and more protein sources that can be texturized and may be employed in the creation of novel plant-based burger-like products. In the final product formulation, hydrated TVP adds the desired juiciness and gives the product a meaty, chewy texture. The capacity of novel protein sources to maintain water in the storage period and free it during cooking and distortion are the main topics of research. Nonetheless, just like ground beef, TVP cannot be used alone to create a cohesive product, necessitating the usage of binders.The major contenders in commercial products are egg protein and methylcellulose, although wheat gluten can also fill this character because it forms a network when wet and aids in binding TVP and other components. Texturizers that have a high water-holding capacity and can make the burger softer and juicier are used to further enhance the texture and mouthfeel of the items. Protein concentrates, protein isolates, and polysaccharides can all be employed to meet the latter ingredient needs. The product\\'s fat, which can be a free, emulsified, liquid or solid plant-based fat, affects the feeling of juiciness as well. To attain the ideal balance, liquid fats (like coconut or palm oil) and solid fats (like sunflower and canola oil) are frequently combined (for example, see the Beyond Burger® and the Impossible TM Burger). Ideal burger fats should be liquid when heated and solid at room temperature. As a result, the food has a satisfying mouthfeel like that of related meat products.Additionally, \"bleeding\" vegetarian burgers use beetroot juice to impart a recognizable meat hue while also attempting to impart a sense of juiciness. By creating new color-changing substances, flavourings, and fragrance precursors, research and development on plant-based burgers are also concentrated on obtaining even higher juiciness and enhancing the look and flavour of these goods.'},\n",

Extrusion is used to create plant-based products that imitate this fibrous or layered structure. To obtain the desired final structure, colour, softness, aroma, and taste change, the items are treated more by freezing, curing, marinating, and cooking. Shear cell technology, which is currently being developed, has the prospective to produce big fragments of fibrous plant-based goods, whereas extrusion can currently only be used to produce small portions of similar products [Concentrates and other fewer refined formulas of soy protein, in addition to isolated soy protein, are employed in extrusion applications [Contingent on whether the result simulates raw or cooked meat, colouring agents and flavours (comprising salt) can either be incorporated in the structuring process or administered as a marinade later.

       "   'body': 'The subject of plant-based meat analogues has been the primary topic of conversation in the food area for quite some time because of expanded concern connected with the well-being influences and supportable advancement of meat choices. People may be more willing to substitute their meat consumption by creating meat analogues, which copy meat with both its nutritional content and its physical sensations. As a result, understanding the study findings on the creation, enhancement, requirement, sustainability, and usefulness of meat analogues is critical in developing a plan for future research in this sector. As a result, this review provides a thorough discussion of the importance of developing meat analogues, the health risks associated with producing meat products, the sources of plant proteins that can be used to develop meat analogues, the functionality of the ingredients used to develop these products, and consumer attitudes towards plant-based meat alternatives. The purpose is to assess the present status of scientific research on PBMA and estimate future research opportunities. Product development is difficult due to the wide range of ingredient functionality requirements across the many forms of plant-based meat substitutes (sausages, burgers, and meatballs). In general, meat analogue applications do not benefit from the functional properties of readily available protein-rich ingredients, the majority of which are highly purified from plant material. The need to use additives to improve product textures is critical. As a result, prospective research must be done to update the functioning of these novel food products and boost public knowledge of plant-based meat substitutes to increase consumer acceptance. Other fractionation techniques, which prioritize functionality over purity, can produce novel functionality. Additionally, novel proteins can provide novel ingredients for meat analog applications.'}]}"

By creating new color-changing substances, flavourings, and fragrance precursors, research and development on plant-based burgers are also concentrated on obtaining even higher juiciness and enhancing the look and flavour of these goods.\"}, {\"section\": \"Chicken-like and steak-like products\", \"body\": \"The imitation of whole-cut meats like chicken, pork, and beef steak, which are distinguished by the occurrence of long fibres or layered structures, is the goal of another category of meat analogue goods. Extrusion is used to create plant-based products that imitate this fibrous or layered structure. To obtain the desired final structure, colour, softness, aroma, and taste change, the items are treated more by freezing, curing, marinating, and cooking. Shear cell technology, which is currently being developed, has the prospective to produce big fragments of fibrous plant-based goods, whereas extrusion can currently only be used to produce small portions of similar products [Concentrates and other fewer refined formulas of soy protein, in addition to isolated soy protein, are employed in extrusion applications [Contingent on whether the result simulates raw or cooked meat, colouring agents and flavours (comprising salt) can either be incorporated in the structuring process or administered as a marinade later. Most applications for flavour addition rely on marination since flavour components are harmed by the conditions utilized in an extruder. According to a patent by Giezen et al.

Moreover, ginger extract and papain resulted in an improvement in the lipid stability of treated burger patties. Therefore, the addition of ginger extract and papain powder to the meat during the formulation of camel burger patties can improve their physicochemical characteristics and sensory properties during storage. Moreover, they can be applied on the industrial scale and household level as an easy method to improve camel burger patties' quality and prevent lipid oxidation during storage [Camel meat burger patties were processed with the addition of ginger extract (7%), papain (0.01%), and a mixture of ginger extract (5%) and papain (0.005%).

Specific mechanical energy (SME) and fibrous degree (FD) are the most important indicators of extruded meat analogues. SME refers to the mechanical energy absorbed per unit mass of extrudates, which translates into the extent of molecular collapse or disintegration of materials during extrusion.

People may be more willing to substitute their meat consumption by creating meat analogues, which copy meat with both its nutritional content and its physical sensations. As a result, understanding the study findings on the creation, enhancement, requirement, sustainability, and usefulness of meat analogues is critical in developing a plan for future research in this sector. As a result, this review provides a thorough discussion of the importance of developing meat analogues, the health risks associated with producing meat products, the sources of plant proteins that can be used to develop meat analogues, the functionality of the ingredients used to develop these products, and consumer attitudes towards plant-based meat alternatives. The purpose is to assess the present status of scientific research on PBMA and estimate future research opportunities. Product development is difficult due to the wide range of ingredient functionality requirements across the many forms of plant-based meat substitutes (sausages, burgers, and meatballs). In general, meat analogue applications do not benefit from the functional properties of readily available protein-rich ingredients, the majority of which are highly purified from plant material. The need to use additives to improve product textures is critical. As a result, prospective research must be done to update the functioning of these novel food products and boost public knowledge of plant-based meat substitutes to increase consumer acceptance. Other fractionation techniques, which prioritize functionality over purity, can produce novel functionality.

We tested two flow-refuge insertion angles (45\\u00b0 and 70\\u00b0), and two flow events (base 7\\u00a0L/s and pulsed-flow 60\\u00a0L/s) for each. To analyze flow-refuge efficiency, we quantified fish individual and group patterns, flow-refuge use, and permanence time, while measuring glucose and lactate responses. The results showed that the individual frequency of use during simulated pulsed-flow was higher, especially on the 45\\u00b0 flow-refuge. The simulated pulsed-flow condition did not disrupt group behavior for both approaching angles. Glucose and lactate analysis did not trigger physiological responses in the tested trials. The 45\\u00b0 flow-refuge was used more often than the 70\\u00b0.

The absence of physiological adjustments among trials, together with the characterization of the flow-field, suggests that the conditions created were not harsh enough to trigger a stress response. The connection between flow variability and stress response is difficult to identify (Costa et al., According to our experimental settings, the two insertion angles create distinct flow-field conditions, with higher velocities found in the narrowest distance (distance between the edge of the refuge and the channel wall) due to the refuge locations.

If this waste is not treated, several environmental problems may arise (e.g. production of nitrous oxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, smoke).

These particles act as an obstacle against the coalescence of droplets\\u00a0(Pickering, Due to their surfactant-free character, some applications of Pickering emulsions, such as in pharmaceutics (Albert et al., Cellulose successfully stabilizes Pickering emulsions due to its amphiphilic nature. These fibers have a hydrophobic face and a hydrophilic edge, enabling them an adequate position at the O/W interface and prevent the coalescence of droplets\\u00a0(Sanchez-Salvador et al., Yuan et al. (The preparation of Pickering emulsions is conventionally performed at lab scale using batch technologies, such as rotor-stator homogenization\\u00a0(Costa et al., This technology is a solution with higher energy efficiency, easy to scale up, and with full control of the process conditions, when compared to other standard processes. Scale-up is ensured by numbering up NETmix units, guaranteeing the same mixing conditions and high-volume scale production.In NETmix, the parameter that has the most influence in mixing is the channel\\u2019s Reynolds number (Re), given byAccording to previous studies, mixing in the chambers occurs above Re of 150, the channel\\u2019s critical Reynolds number. For these conditions, there is the formation of a self-sustainable chaotic flow regime able to mix the two liquid streams efficiently (Fonte et al., The use of NETmix for the production of emulsions is quite promising since the dynamic flow regime generated in this mesomixer enables the easy control of droplet size, assuring the effective temperature control, which is not controlled in traditional batch reactors (e.g. rotor-stator homogenizers) (Ribeiro et al., This paper proposes the use of the high-yield biomass, containing micro and nano cellulose fibrils, (LCMNFs) to stabilize Pickering emulsions for food applications. The main novelties are first the scale-up of the production of stable Pickering emulsions in continuous mode; second, the complete valorization of leek trimmings, which are usually thrown away despite being edible. This treatment does not use chemical treatments and is low cost, making them suitable for food applications. According to FoodData Central of U.S. Department of Agriculture, leek has a low percentage of fat. Thus, leek trimmings are perfect for adding flavour to calorie-controlled diet.

Leek trimmings are perfectly edible but currently, they are considered waste. Since they are fat-free, their addition to food will add flavour and contribute to a calorie-controlled diet. O/W Pickering emulsions were successfully stabilized with high-yield LCB pulps from leek trimmings containing LCMNFs, using both batch and continuous mode processes. Since the fibers treatment does not involve the use of chemicals, they can be widely used for the preparation of food-grade Pickering emulsions. Potential applications of these emulsions in the food industry are in vegan sauces or butter for seasoning.In batch mode, the Pickering emulsions were produced using a rotor-stator homogenizer, promoting the blending of sunflower oil, water, and the LCB pulp. In the continuous process, the sunflower oil and water are continuously fed to the NETmix reactor, a technology developed at the University of Porto.In batch mode, an EI over 92\\u00a0wt.% was achieved after 48\\u00a0h for all O/W ratios studied (20/80, 30/70, and 40/60\\u00a0wt.%) at the optimal dosage. As observed from OM, CLSM, and cryo-SEM images, the LCMNFs contained in the LCB pulp formed a barrel of fibers capable of enclosing the oil droplets, avoiding their coalescence.However, the production of the most stable batch formulations at O/W ratios of 30/70\\u00a0wt.% (LCB 4.2*\\u00a0wt.%) and 40/60\\u00a0wt.% (LCB\\u00a03.6*\\u00a0wt.%) gave lower stability results (EI over 70 wt.%) in continuous mode. MO and cryo-SEM images show that the droplet size is larger in batch than in continuous mode, due to the higher shear rate generated in the NETmix reactor. Since the droplet size is larger in batch mode, the surface area that needs to be covered by the LCMNFs network is smaller.Therefore, the proof of concept shows the potential of using fiber solid particles to produce Pickering emulsions with vegetable wastes in the NETmix reactor although further studies are required to improve their stability. The continuous production using NETmix reactor ensures their compatibility to the industrial manufacturing processes.\"}]}, {\"meta_data\": {\"content_type\": \"Article\", \"url\": [{\"format\": \"\", \"platform\": \"\", \"value\": \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-024-03384-5\"}], \"title\": \"Woody invaders of a temperate forest have unique root-associated fungal communities\", \"publication_name\": \"Biological Invasions\", \"doi\": \"10.1007/s10530-024-03384-5\", \"publication_date\": \"2024-10-01\", \"starting_page\": \"3495\", \"ending_page\": \"3510\", \"open_access\": \"true\", \"abstract\": {\"h1\": \"Abstract\", \"p\": \"Non-native, invasive plants are increasingly common in Eastern North American forests, but their impact on soil fungi remains unclear.

OTU composition was influenced by host mycorrhizal type and by AM plant nativity, with mycorrhizal fungi being important drivers in both cases. The relationships of soil characteristics (e.g., pH) with OTU composition were independent of plant nativity and mycorrhizal type. Specific root length of native AM species was lower than that of invasive AM plants, while EM plants were intermediate. Irrespective of plant type, OTU composition was distinct among plant species, particularly in fungal communities associated with the invader Rhamnus cathartica .

For example, The distinction between AM and EM plants necessitates another consideration when assessing the impacts of invasive species on soil fungi. Forests dominated by AM trees tend to be more prone to invasion by understory plants (Jo et al. Belowground enemy release may play a role in some invasions (Reinhart et al. We also found that soil fungal communities were associated with some soil properties, independent of plant composition. One of the strongest gradients was associated with pH and soil C mineralization potential, indicating the presence of more labile C and/or greater saprotrophic fungal activity at lower pH in our sites. Although the lack of connection between plant identity and soil properties can in part be explained by the relatively diffuse distribution of invaders at our site, it is surprising that EM plants also did not shift soil processes, given that EM symbioses are associated with distinct soil nutrient cycling dynamic compared to those of AM symbioses (Read and Perez-Moreno The results presented here highlight the impact that invasive AM woody plants can have early in the invasion process. This has distinct ramifications for native AM and EM plants in forest understories, which present unique consequences for fungal diversity even in the initial absence of other modifications by invasives to the soil ecosystem (i.e., nutrient and carbon cycling).

Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis performed on the set of 53 wetlands revealed significant differences in diatom composition among the four conductivity groups. The key species in the eusaline group were Tryblionella pararostrata , Halamphora sp.1 and Cocconeis euglypta , whereas in the mesosaline and oligosaline group, these were Navicula veneta , Tryblionella hungarica and Nitzschia inconspicua .

Moreover, species turnover in these wetlands is mainly explained by the variations in conductivity, this being revealed as an important factor driving variation in diatoms communities as reported by different studies in both lotic and lentic systems (Reed, Electric conductivity is associated with ionic concentration, but differences in ionic composition can also determine species associations in ecosystems (Cumming et al., High ionic concentration, dominated by either ClWetlands belonging to the fresh group include siliceous and calcareous mountain wetlands, located at high altitude (Supplementary information Table Although our results demonstrate shifts in epipelic taxa and the presence of rare and presumably new species along different gradient of conductivity, the knowledge about the taxa needs improvement.

Island ecosystems that developed in isolation from mammals are particularly threatened by introduced mammalian predators. This is the case in New Zealand, where introduced mammalian predators have caused the decline of native birds, lizards, and invertebrates. In alpine areas of New Zealand, predator control targets stoats, rats, and cats as they are recognised as the key threats to native birds. Mice, which are known predators of invertebrates at lower elevations, are not actively controlled. As a result, alpine invertebrates in New Zealand represent an ideal focus for a natural experiment to understand the effects of predator control efforts and invasive mice on native invertebrates that evolved in isolation from mammals. In the Fiordland region of New Zealand, we assessed the large-bodied alpine invertebrate community at eight different sites that vary in their occurrence of mice and control of higher-order predators. We found that the recent presence of mice influenced the invertebrate community: w\\u0113t\\u0101 (a group of native orthopterans) were less common at sites where mice were present, and the mean body size of invertebrates collected in pitfall traps was larger at sites where mice were absent compared to sites where they were present. Control of other predators (specifically rats and mustelids) did not influence invertebrate body size, abundance, or community composition.

Lastly, the presence of predator control targeting stoats, rats and or cats had no significant effect on invertebrate community composition, abundance, or body size.At lower elevations, there is strong international evidence that mice influence invertebrate abundance, body size and community composition (Marris The lack of an effect of the presence of mice on the invertebrate community in our study could be a result of the low number of mice that were active during our sampling period. Although mice are known to be consistently absent from our mouse-free sites, mouse abundance can vary greatly at sites where they are present as mouse populations boom and bust with food availability (often associated with Though there is little information on mouse diet in alpine areas of New Zealand, Wilson and Lee (Although we detected likely effects of mouse pressure on the alpine invertebrate fauna, there are alternative explanations for why invertebrate body size may differ between sites with and without mice.

Our study makes initial contributions to understanding the relationship between large-bodied invertebrates and the suite of introduced predators in New Zealand\\u2019s alpine areas. Our results suggest that mice influence large-bodied invertebrate body size and community composition, particularly the presence of w\\u0113t\\u0101, and we were able to detect these differences in a year when mouse abundance was low. Further work comparing periods of high and low mouse abundance is required to better understand this dynamic. Predator control efforts, primarily targeting stoats, were not found to influence the invertebrate community despite stoats being known predators of invertebrates. These results suggest that predator control needs to be extended to include mice to benefit large-bodied invertebrates in alpine areas of New Zealand. Our findings also support trends in other studies where controlling for a single predator instead of the full suite of predators can limit conservation outcomes for native fauna. As a result, we need to ensure that our predator control programmes are more comprehensive and account for the interactions between predator species to maximise conservation outcomes.\"}, {\"section\": \"Competing interests\", \"body\": \"The authors have no competing interests to disclose.\"}]}, {\"meta_data\": {\"content_type\": \"Article\", \"url\": [{\"format\": \"\", \"platform\": \"\", \"value\": \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-024-04566-0\"}], \"title\": \"Investigating the interfacial and bulk rheological properties of emulsions containing dry bean powder\", \"publication_name\": \"European Food Research and Technology\", \"doi\": \"10.1007/s00217-024-04566-0\", \"publication_date\": \"2024-10-01\", \"starting_page\": \"2659\", \"ending_page\": \"2668\", \"open_access\": \"true\", \"abstract\": {\"h1\": \"Abstract\", \"p\": \"This study aimed to investigate the impact of varying proportions of dry bean powder on the rheological properties of oil-in-water emulsions. Emulsions were formulated utilizing xanthan gum or dry bean powder across a range of concentrations, including 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Additionally, a control emulsion (CTR) was formulated using xanthan gum exclusively. The rheological properties of the resulting emulsions, both linear and nonlinear, were characterized. Moreover, the correlation between microstructural attributes and the interfacial rheological response within these emulsion systems was thoroughly examined. A prominent observation was the occurrence of shear thinning, characterized by a reduction in viscosity under applied shear stress. Notably, the control emulsion (CTR) displayed the lowest interfacial viscosity values, whereas emulsions incorporating increasing proportions of dry bean powder demonstrated a proportional rise in interfacial viscosity. The highest consistency coefficient and apparent viscosity was recorded in the 7%DB sample with a value of 3.23\\u00a0Pa.sn and 0.56\\u00a0Pa.s, respectively. This suggests that emulsions formulated with dry bean powder may yield a more resilient interfacial film, attributed to the protein content inherent in dry beans. The establishment of a viscoelastic interfacial layer facilitated by dry bean powder in appropriate concentrations significantly contributes to the long-term stability of the emulsion. Unraveling the intricate relationship between interfacial behaviors holds paramount importance in advocating for the utilization of dry bean powder as a plant-based protein source. In conclusion, the incorporation of dry bean powder enhances the formation of interfacial films in O/W emulsions.\"}}, \"content\": [{\"section\": \"Introduction\", \"body\": \"In recent times, an increasing demand among consumers for vegan options has emerged, driven by a desire for both veganism and sustainability, with the appeal of plant-based products\\u2014characterized by their cholesterol-free, antibiotic-free, and absence of potential microbial residues\\u2014contributing to this rising trend [Dry beans play a significant role in human nutrition, serving as a vital source of protein, dietary fiber, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. They contribute substantially to dietary protein intake. Beyond their nutritional value, proteins in dry beans fulfill various roles in plant-based foods. These functions encompass hydration, surface activity, structural integrity, hydration-related properties, and certain sensory attributes. The importance of dry bean proteins extends to both human and animal nutrition, featuring water-soluble components (albumins) and dilute salt-soluble storage proteins (globulin) [As previously mentioned, existing studies on bean powder and protein lack insights into the structural aspects of O/W (oil-in-water) emulsions. Particularly, there is a dearth of information regarding the influence on linear and non-linear interfacial and bulk rheological behavior, with no prior study of interfacial rheology. Conversely, a comprehensive understanding of the interconnection between structure and function, as well as interactions among components at the O/W emulsion interface, can be gleaned by examining the nonlinear viscoelastic properties of these emulsions. Hence, this study aims to achieve the following objectives: (1) investigate the impact of O/W emulsions on the formation and microstructure of dry bean powder-based emulsions; (2) characterize the linear and nonlinear rheological properties exhibited by the resulting emulsions; and (3) explore the correlation between microstructure and interfacial rheological response within these emulsion systems. Considering the nutritional advantages identified in dry bean emulsion formulations, this research seeks to build upon existing knowledge by evaluating the influence of different ratio (1,3,5 and 7%) of dry bean powder on the quality attributes of the emulsions.

We recommend avoiding supplementation of vitamin A and suggest water-soluble vitamin supplementation for those on dialysis. In the absence of evidence, a consistent structured approach to vitamin management that considers assessment and monitoring from dietary, physical, and biochemical viewpoints is needed. Careful consideration of the impact of accumulation, losses, comorbidities, and medications needs to be explored for the individual child and vitamin before supplementation can be considered. When supplementing, care needs to be taken not to over-prescribe.

In addition, the food that children eat must provide adequate energy, protein, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. We have published a number of CPRs for single dietary components but, given the multiple effects of CKD and the complex nutritional needs of children, it is impossible to act on a single nutrient without impacting other aspects of the diet. This educational review discusses how to integrate the CPRs in a practical way. For children with multiple nutritional needs, it is essential to engage the family by taking a holistic approach, considering the diet as a whole and not simply concentrating on nutrients as separate components of the diet. To successfully navigate these dietary complexities, families greatly benefit from the expertise of a pediatric kidney dietitian to guide them in providing a diet that is both manageable, enjoyable to eat, meets any necessary restrictions, and provides adequate nutrition. A multidisciplinary team should consistently communicate the same messages about nutrition to provide support to the family. Educational resources, whether verbal, written, pictorial, or digital, must be adapted to suit the learning style of the child and family so that they understand the need for any nutritional interventions.

A temporary reduction of dietary calcium may also be necessary. Substituting milk in the diet with a specialized low-calcium infant formula or incorporating it into all, or part, of any enteral formula should be considered. Using deionized or distilled water also reduces calcium intake. Regular assessment of dietary calcium is required, especially when calcium intake is reduced below the SDI. Hypercalcemia may also be due to hypervitaminosis A and if detected, should prompt a reduction in vitamin A intake, but ensuring the maintenance of optimal nutrition.Hyperphosphatemia is very commonly seen in children with kidney failure and the IPPN registry showed that the prevalence of hyperphosphatemia increased with age from 6% in young infants to 81% in adolescents [The single most effective dietary modification to reduce phosphate intake is the avoidance of processed foods containing phosphate additives. These are commonly added to meat and fish products (sausages, salamis, burgers, chicken nuggets, fish fingers), commercial bakery items (cakes, biscuits, crumpets, tortilla wraps, naan bread), potato products (frozen chips, waffles), dairy foods (milk desserts, yogurts, ice cream, cheese slice slices and spreads), dark-colored carbonated (fizzy) drinks, and chocolate- and malt-based drinks. It is crucial to educate children and their caregivers about the importance of reading food labels diligently and being vigilant about avoiding products that include \\u201cphos\\u201d in the ingredient list. The inorganic phosphate salts added to processed foods are not organically bound to, or associated with, phytate, resulting in an extremely high bioavailability of up to 100% [If avoidance of phosphate additives does not control serum phosphate levels sufficiently, fresh foods naturally high in phosphate (milk, cheese, yogurt, eggs, meat, fish, and nuts) may need to be reduced. These high phosphate, high nutritional value foods, which provide important protein in the diet, are preferable to low nutritional value items such as cola drinks and chocolate. In more advanced CKD, phosphate binders may be required in addition to dietary phosphate restriction. Binders should be taken in conjunction with phosphate-containing meals and snacks.For children reliant on enteral tube feeds whose phosphate intake needs to be reduced, a pediatric formula can be mixed with a whey-dominant infant formula or specialized renal-specific low potassium formula which also has a lower phosphate content. Renal-specific formulas should not be used as the sole source of nutrition due to their low potassium content which may cause a precipitous fall in serum potassium. Supplementary Table\\u00a0In the case of hypophosphatemia, dietary phosphate should be increased to achieve age-appropriate serum phosphate levels. The most effective way to do this is to offer more foods naturally high in phosphate; phosphate supplements may be necessary if this approach is not tolerated or does not correct the hypophosphatemia.While potassium excretion is not usually affected until GFR is <15\\u201320 mL/min/1.73 mThere are no data on the potassium requirements for children with CKD, probably due to the large variability in kidney excretion.

The composition of infant and pediatric renal-specific formulas is given in Supplementary Table\\u00a0In the case of hypokalemia, the initial approach is to address any underlying medical causes, such as excessive dialysate potassium losses, medications (potassium binding resins, diuretics), gastrointestinal losses (vomiting, diarrhea), or metabolic alkalosis. Severe, life-threatening hypokalemia requires prompt medical intervention, usually with intravenous potassium.

Due to the abundance of mosquito vectors in this locality, the population exposed to mosquito-borne diseases is therefore also increasing, as is the risk of epidemic episodes. The aim of the present study was to assess, in a resource-limited setting, the information on mosquito population dynamics and disease transmission risk that can be provided through a longitudinal entomological study carried out in a multi-host single site.\", \"Methods\", \"Mosquitoes were collected every 15\\u00a0days over 16\\u00a0months (from January 2017 to April 2018) using six CDC-light traps in a peri-urban area of Antananarivo. Multivariable generalised linear models were developed using indoor and outdoor densities of the predominant mosquito species as response variables and moon illumination, environmental data and climatic data as the explanatory variables.\", \"Results\", \"Overall, 46,737 mosquitoes belonging to at least 20 species were collected, of which Culex antennatus (68.9%), Culex quinquefasciatus (19.8%), Culex poicilipes (3.7%) and Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (2.3%) were the most abundant species. Mosquito densities were observed to be driven by moon illumination and climatic factors interacting at different lag periods. The outdoor models demonstrated biweekly and seasonal patterns of mosquito densities, while the indoor models demonstrated only a seasonal pattern.\", \"Conclusions\", \"An important diversity of mosquitoes exists in the peri-urban area of Antananarivo. Some well-known vector species, such as Cx. antennatus , a major vector of West Nile virus (WNV) and Rift-Valley fever virus (RVFV), Cx. quinquefasciatus , a major vector of WNV, Cx. poicilipes , a candidate vector of RVFV and An. gambiae sensu lato, a major vector of Plasmodium spp., are abundant. Importantly, these four mosquito species are present all year round, even though their abundance declines during the cold dry season, with the exception of Cx. quinquefasciatus . The main drivers of their abundance were found to be temperature, relative humidity and precipitation, as well as\\u2014for outdoor abundance only\\u2014moon illumination.

Detection of BoDV-1 in shrews as the only known reservoir hosts would provide the most accurate information on its endemic presence. However, representative samples from shrews are not easily accessible. To date, these data are highly fragmented and biased due to active sampling at only a few locationsOur analyses supported the previously introduced phylogenetic clusters and subclustersWe found the BoDV-1 clusters and subclusters to be genetically remarkably stable over time and to be associated with spatial distribution rather than time of detection or host species, as demonstrated previouslyTo indicate the regions in which BoDV-1 variants of particular clusters or subclusters are endemic, we defined criteria for those sequences that indicate the endemic presence of the virus with reasonable reliability. Due to the limitations described above, a single BoDV-1 detection in a domestic mammal or human spatially separated from its closest viral relative cannot be considered as an indicator of endemicity. It rather needs to be supported by additional genetically related sequences from the same region. We have tentatively defined the criteria for considering sequences as indicators of endemicity to be at least two sequences with at least 98.6% nt sequence identity within a 37.9\\u2009km diameter. Applying these criteria, the ~10% of the sequences with the highest spatial distance from their closest relatives are regarded as phylogeographic outliers and excluded from further analysis. We used N-X/P nt sequence identities rather than patristic distances to make the analysis more easily applicable to further cases diagnosed in the future. A comparative analysis confirmed that using patristic distances led to consistent results, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. The criteria defined in this study may be subject to further refinement as more extensive data will become available. Visualisation of the distribution of the BoDV-1 sequences after removal of the phylogeographic outliers confirmed and refined the previously assumed pattern of endemic areasGeographic outliers do occasionally occur distant from the indicated distribution areas of their phylogenetic clades or even completely outside the defined endemic area of BoDV-1. Due to the limitations of the available metadata, it cannot be excluded that at least some of these cases may be the result of inaccurately reported locations. Others may be the result of travel within the incubation period, as previously describedSuch clear epidemiological links could not be established for the majority of phylogeographic outliers identified in this study. While no further information was available for most of these cases, some animals were reported to have never travelled to known endemic areas, or even to have remained in their holding of birth throughout their lives, thus suggesting the existence of so far unidentified infection sources in these regions. Whether or not BoDV-1 can be transmitted over long distances by passive vectors, such as import of contaminated feed, remains elusive. So far, no such cases have been documented and data on the environmental tenacity of the virus are sparse. Thus, at least some of the latter cases may actually indicate the endemic presence of the virus in local shrew populations, requiring confirmation by detection of additional genetically related viruses from their region. For instance, the phylogenetic analyses of the previously published human case Z19_0107 from BB had grouped the virus to cluster 3 that had not been detected in this region beforeOur study increases the number of published laboratory-confirmed human BoDV-1-infections to 46 and provides a first comprehensive summary of metadata for all published casesThe detailed phylogeographic network of animal-derived BoDV-1 sequences assembled in this study also allowed for a first phylogenetic assessment of potential geographic sources of human BoDV-1 infections. With the exception of three organ transplant-derived infectionsThe exact source and route of transmission remain elusive for almost all BoDV-1 infections in humans and domestic mammals. Due to its almost exclusively neurotropic nature in non-reservoir hostsPrevious studies have hypothesised a higher risk of BoDV-1 transmission to domestic mammals during winter, leading to disease outbreaks and eventually death during spring and early summer. Shrews entering animal stables in search of feed have been suggested to be responsible for this patternIn summary, we performed a highly comprehensive phylogeographic analysis of the occurrence of the zoonotic pathogen BoDV-1 in Central Europe. The improved resolution of the phylogeographic data will provide a basis for assessing potential locations and sources of BoDV-1 infection in animals and humans. The visualisation of potential risk areas will allow for the implementation of prophylactic measures \\u2013 mainly reducing the risk of exposure to the reservoir \\u2013 in the affected regions.

Unfortunately, the debate centered primarily on the fairness of taxes on SUP while ignoring potential adverse health effects from exposure to SUP and other plastics, their disintegration products (Micro-Nano-Plastics: MNP), additives and contaminants. In this review, we focus on these health effects in order that future policy discussions and proposals will consider not only the environmental damage caused by plastics, but also their potential adverse health effects.We present potential dangers to health from MNP, which can enter our bodies through various exposure routes including inhalation, eating, drinking and touch.We also review adverse health effects of common classes of additives to plastic and emphasize the potential for additives to plastic to leach into food and drink from\\u00a0plastic containers used for storing, heating, and serving food and beverages, as well as from plastic fabrics and personal care products (PCP) (See Figs. Sources of exposure to MNP and exposure line indicating the sizes that can cross epithelial barriers of the GI tract, respiratory tract, and skin. Citations: Ingestion [To evaluate adverse health risks of exposure to plastic, microplastic or their additives, there needs to be evidence of exposure. We present that evidence in this paper. We also summarize the growing body of research based on laboratory, epidemiological and pathological studies that point to serious adverse health effects from our widespread exposure to plastics, microplastics and their additives.As the basis for policy recommendations, we have included sections detailing the extent of plastic and MNP pollution in Israel, as well as sections summarizing international treaties and conventions, Israeli laws, regulations, and standards, along with the activities of Israeli NGOs to decrease plastic pollution. Finally, we present policy recommendations to decrease the public's exposure to adverse health effects from plastic, MNP and their additives.\"}, {\"section\": \"Main text\", \"body\": \"\\\"Plastic\\\" is not one substance, but a class of polymers that are usually synthesized from fossil fuels. Their properties of flexibility, durability, lightweight, water repellency, and low cost have led to their use in virtually every aspect of our lives. Plastics have become one of the most ubiquitous materials in use world-wide over the past 70 years [MP can be directly manufactured as microbeads, and micropellets for the making of various commercial products, in addition to being formed by fragmentation of macroplastic [In this paper, we use the term MNP for all microplastics less than 5\\u00a0mm, unless there is a finding that relates to MP or NP only (See Fig.\\u00a0The final plastic product bought by the consumer typically contains additives such as stabilizers which prevent degradation of the plastic and thereby also prevent degradation of plastic waste [Other additives add qualities of flexibility (\\\"plasticizers\\\"), flame retardation, pigmentation, anti-oxidation, and the ability to repel water and/or grease, to list the qualities of just of few of the many additives [Few countries require prior toxicological analysis of possible adverse health effects of new plastics and chemical additives that enter the global market. The European Union has regulations under its REACH program requiring the testing of new chemicals for human toxicity before their approval for marketing [Plastic waste can form mats which float in aqueous environments. The plastic mats tend to accumulate contaminants, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, algae, fungi and bacteria, including pathogenic bacteria [MNP have wide dispersion in the environment. They have been found in the atmosphere, oceans and rivers, rain and snow, dust and soil, wastewater of sewage treatment plants and in the air surrounding plastic recycling facilities [MNP smaller than 10 microns can cross epithelial barriers in the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) systems while only NP can cross the dermal barrier. Their ability to enter tissues of the body are size-dependent, with small particles (<\\u200910\\u00b5m) having the potential to cross epithelial barriers of the alveoli of the lungs and the GI tract and enter body tissues, including the blood and lymphatic systems [Larger MP are excreted from the GI tract in feces and from the respiratory tract via snot, sputum, sneezing and coughing [There also exists a paracellular transport mechanism in the lungs and GI tract that allow the transport of MP particles, less than 130 \\u00b5m in size, across the epithelium into body tissues [Data on human exposure to MNP are an essential part of risk-analysis of possible adverse health effects from exposure to MNP. We present the current state of knowledge of the extent of human exposure to MNP in the following paragraphs.MNP are found in both out-door and indoor air, with higher concentrations in indoor air [A recent systematic review, published in 2024, summarized all the studies since 2017 which presented data on MP in both indoor and outdoor air [As shown in Fig.\\u00a0Beverages are another source of exposure to MNP. In a study of 11 global brands of drinking water bottled in plastic containers [Recently, a method was developed which enabled measurement of NP in water. Using this method, concentrations of MNP in water bottled in plastic containers were 2.4\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910Another source of MNP in beverages are tea bags, which when steeped in hot water, release 2.3\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910Infant formula prepared and/or stored in plastic bottles are another area of particular concern. Release of 1.3\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910MP are also found in disposable plastic cups for drinking and single-use food containers for home delivery [Paper cups are often considered to be a safe alternative to plastic cups when drinking hot beverages. However, paper cups have an interior lining, usually made of polyethylene plastic, which degrades into MP when exposed to water over 85\\u00a0\\u00b0C. These MP then leach into the hot beverage, with a release of 2.5\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910In an article from 2019, annual MP consumption via food was estimated to range from 39,000 to 52,000 particles depending on age and sex, with estimates increasing to 74,000 and 113,000 when inhalation is considered. Individuals who drink only water and beverages bottled in plastic were estimated to be ingesting an additional 90,000 MP annually, compared to 4000 MP for those who drink only tap water [Dermal exposure to MNP can occur through use of personal care products (PCP) such as cosmetics, soap, skin conditioners, toothpaste, lip balms, exfoliants, glitter, and artificial plastic eye lashes [There is growing emphasis in the literature on childhood as a critical time for exposure to MNP [Exposure to MNP through the vulnerable stages of infancy and childhood. Citations: In utero: Placenta [Exposure of fetuses in utero and newborn infants to MNP is documented by the findings of MP on the fetal side of the human placenta [The early years of childhood are characterized by exploration of the world by crawling, picking up, tasting, and chewing plastic objects that infants encounter in their explorations. Children ingest and inhale more liquids, food, and air than adults per body weight (BW) and are thereby exposed to a higher dose level of MP/kilogram BW [The dermal barrier to environmental pollutants is not fully formed until age four, providing another route of exposure to MNP in infants and young children. Those with inflammation or abrasion of their skin are particularly vulnerable to trans-dermal absorption of MP [Older children can be exposed to MNP at playgrounds, as well as in their homes, daycare, and schools. Mean MP concentrations at children's outdoor playgrounds in Los Angeles were found to be 5 times greater than concentrations outside the playgrounds in the same parks [Infants and children are not only directly exposed to MNP, but also to toxic additives that can leach from the MNP into body tissues (See Sects.\\u00a0\\\"Since MNP do not degrade, those particles which enter the human body through ingestion, inhalation or touch, but are not excreted, can be expected to accumulate in tissues of the human body. Tissue accumulation of MP has been demonstrated in marine organisms and mammals [Given the extensive evidence of exposure to MNP from various sources, it is not surprising that MNP have been found in multiple organs of people (See Fig.\\u00a0Organs of the human body in which MNP have been found. Citations: [MNP have not yet been found in the human brain. However, studies in mice show that polystyrene NP spheres\\u2009<\\u200950\\u00a0nm in diameter can cross the blood\\u2013brain barrier in mice [Adverse health effects of human exposure to MNP from inhalation, ingestion or touch are influenced by the size, shape and chemical composition of the plastic, additives, and chemical, bacterial and heavy metal contaminants that adsorb onto the MNP [Inflammation and oxidative stress can be caused by MNP that cross the GI, respiratory or dermal epithelial barriers and enter various organs of the body via the circulatory or lymphatic systems [Inhaled MNP contribute to the body burden of inhaled small particulate matter (PM) if they are small enough to reach bronchioles and alveoli [The first study has just been published with direct evidence of adverse health effects from exposure to MNP [The 257 consenting patients were followed prospectively for a mean of 34 months. Those who had MNP in their plaques had significantly higher rates of a composite score of myocardial infarction, stroke or death from any cause than those who had no MNP in their plaques, with a Hazard Ratio of 4.53 (CI of 2.00\\u201310.27) and p\\u2009<\\u20090.001.Those with MNP in their carotid artery plaques had elevated levels of biomarkers of inflammation: interleukin-18, interleukin- 1\\u03b2, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\\u03b1). These findings support the inflammatory effects of intracellular MNP, as cited earlier in this Sect.\\u00a0[This study is the first human study to fulfill one of the main conditions for postulating a causal relationship between exposure to MNP and an adverse health outcome: the exposure (MNP in the carotid artery plaques) occurred before the adverse health outcome. The finding of increased biomarkers of inflammation in the plaques of those who subsequently had adverse health outcomes supports the biological plausibility of the association, thus fulfilling another criterion for establishing a causal relationship. However, as the authors of the study point out, they cannot rule out that the results were confounded by other risk factors that were not included in the study design.The recent findings of MNP in human reproductive organs (the maternal and fetal sides of placentas, testes and semen), as well as in breast milk, are a cause for concern. More research is needed to evaluate their potential threat to our reproductive system [Additives to plastic of major health concern include toxic metals, such as lead, cadmium, arsenic and chromium [We review three major additives to plastics which are EDCs: Bisphenols, Phthalates, PFAS.Bisphenols are used in the manufacture of single-use and multiple-use polycarbonate bottles for beverages, containers for the storage of food, kitchen utensils, toys, dental sealants and even water pipes. They are used in the manufacture of epoxy resins which are used to line food and beverage cans. They can leach from food and drink containers into the food we eat and the beverages we drink [The vast majority of the population of the world is exposed to bisphenol A (BPA). The half-life of BPA in the human body is short (approximately 6 h). In a study by the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), over 92% of Americans were found to have detectable levels of BPA in their urine, reflecting ubiquitous exposure to BPA. Measurable levels of BPA have been found in maternal and fetal blood and placenta and in the milk of nursing mothers [Phthalates are plasticizersThe source of phthalates in meat and dairy products can be from exposure to phthalates in animals from which meat and dairy products are made, thereby allowing phthalates to enter the human food chain through the food itself, as well as through phthalates in the plastic packaging in which meat, fish and dairy products are marketed [The phthalate DEHP is widely used in medical care products since DEHP is an integral part of the PVC which is used for the manufacture of intravenous bags, tubing, dialysis equipment, and surgical gloves.Phthalates have a short half-life in the human body since they are rapidly metabolized and excreted in the urine. Surveys in the US have found that virtually everyone is exposed to phthalates on a daily basis. DEHP and its metabolites are present in 90\\u2013100% of samples of second-trimester amniotic fluid and are also found in cord blood of newborns, breast milk and ovarian follicular fluid [PFAS have grease- and water-resistant properties and are therefore found in many consumer products as additives to plastics such as polyester, nylon and vinyl fabrics, which are widely used for the manufacture of clothes, rugs, cushions, drapes and textile-covered furniture. Disintegration of these plastics allows for the creation of microfibers containing PFAS, which can be a source of human exposure to PFAS via inhalation or oral contact. PFAS can often be found in coatings of nonstick cookware, wrappers for take-away food, as well as many other consumer items. They can be found as additives to industrial equipment for the manufacture of food items and/or plastic bins in which food is stored or shipped. Since PFAS do not bind to plastic, they can migrate easily from plastic to food and beverages. PFAS has been found in some \\\"biodegradable\\\" bowls that are marketed as safe replacements for plastic bowls.Due to their wide-spread use, PFAS chemicals are now ubiquitous, both in the environment and in the general population. Measurable concentrations of PFAS chemicals were found in the blood of 98% of participants, aged 12 and older, in the US CDCs National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey performed in 2003\\u20132004 [Four PFAS chemicals (PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS) are almost universally detectable in the blood of pregnant women, neonates and children around the world, as well as in human breast milk. These chemicals can also cross the placental barrier and enter the fetus [There is a vast and rapidly growing body of literature on adverse health effects of EDCs. They are chemicals called xenohormones whose structure is similar to that of naturally occurring human endocrine hormones (EDCs have biological effects throughout the life cycle, from the fetus, throughout infancy and childhood, adolescence, adulthood and aging [Of particular concern is the increasing evidence of multi-generational effects of exposure to EDCs. Exposure of a pregnant woman to EDCs can affect the health of her fetus, not only in utero but also during the growth and development of her newborn infant throughout childhood and adolescence and even into adulthood [Maternal exposure to EDCs can also affect the development of a male fetus. Maternal occupational exposure to EDCs during pregnancy has been found to be associated with poor sperm quality and concentrations in their adult sons [The Endocrine Society's Authoritative Guide emphasizes that adverse health effects of exposure to EDCs can occur at very low doses and that therefore there is likely no \\\"safe\\\" dose of exposure to EDCs. The Guide also emphasizes that there can be a long latency between exposure to EDCs and adverse health effects [The Endocrine Society [Bisphenol A (BPA), F (BPF) and S (BPS) are those bisphenols for which there is the most evidence of adverse health effects [In adults, exposure to BPA and BPS is associated with increased risk of diabetes. In children, prenatal exposure to BPA is associated with increased levels of body fat, ADHD and behavior problems [Due to all the adverse health effects associated with BPA, it has been classified by the REACH regulation of the EU as a substance of very high concern (SVHC) [Exposure to BPA and its analogs (BPF, BPS, BPAF, TBBPA) negatively affect reproductive health of women [Analogs are increasingly used as substitutes for BPA, which has been banned in baby bottles, baby \\\"sipping\\\" cups and pacifiers in many countries. Since these analogs resemble BPA in their structure, there is growing concern that these substitutes for BPA may also affect the human reproductive system [Phthalates affect estrogen and testosterone levels and function, and block thyroid action. They are therefore considered to be reproductive toxicants and classified by the EU as SVHC.Prenatal exposure to phthalates is associated with preterm birth [A recent analysis was performed of prospective studies of the associations between prenatal exposure to phthalates (as measured by gestational maternal urinary phthalates DEHP, DiDP, DnOP and DiNP) and birth outcomes (gestational age at birth, birthweight, birth length and birthweight-for-gestational age Z-scores) in 5006 mother\\u2013child dyads in 13 cohorts of diverse populations in the United States. Analysis of pooled data from the ECHO cohort study [Male infants exposed to the phthalate DEHP during the first trimester of pregnancy have shorter ano-genital distance (AGD), while those exposed during the second trimester have smaller penile width at birth [In women, chronic exposure to phthalates is associated with decreased fertility, increased rates of miscarriages, and increased rates of complications of pregnancy, such as toxemia and preeclampsia. Exposure to the phthalate DEHP is associated with increased risk of endometriosis [In adult men, chronic exposure to phthalates (especially benzyl and butyl phthalates) is associated with decreased testosterone levels, decreased sperm counts and sperm quality, resulting in a decrease in male fertility. A cross-sectional study of fertile men in the US, found an association between urinary MBzP concentrations and decreased sperm motility [In adults, both male and female, exposure to phthalates is associated with obesity, diabetes, and other risk factors for CVD, including elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance and elevated levels of triglycerides [In 2015 the Endocrine Society published a review of endocrine disrupting effects of EDCs [Prenatal exposure to PFAS is associated with low birth weight and childhood obesity. Exposure during pregnancy is also associated with impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in the mother [In adult males, PFAS exposure is associated with lower semen quality and semen counts [Some of the PFAS chemicals are carcinogenic [PFOA was classified as a human carcinogen in 2023 [PFOS was classified in 2023 as a possible human carcinogen [The testing of the toxicity of EDCs requires analysis of endocrine effects at various doses, for various periods of times, in multiple organs of exposed laboratory animals (compared with controls), as well as study of carcinogenesis. Study of the effects of maternal exposure of laboratory animals to EDCs on their offsrping includes analysis of congenital defects, growth and development (physical, neuro-behavioral, endocrinological and sexual), epigenetic effects, carcinogenesis and second-generation effects. The EDC being tested is administered to the laboratory animal at various doses, and given at various phases of pregnancy.For a good example, see Stahl's review on the toxicology of PFAS [For example, The EU has classified the NOAEL for reproductive and development effects of the phthalate DEHP as 4.8\\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day and the TDI (tolerable daily intake) as 0.05\\u00a0mg/kg BW/day [For bisphenols, in 2023 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) lowered its recommendations for TDI for BPA to 0.2 nanograms/kg of BW/day, a level 20,000 times lower than the TDI recommended previously in their report of 2015, based on a review of 800 new publications. The EU has also taken steps to decrease exposure to BPA via food contact materials, by setting a Specific Migration Limit (SML) of 0.05 mg of bisphenol A per kilogram of food (Regulation (EU) 2018/213), along with a ban on BPA in the manufacture of polycarbonate baby bottles (Regulation (EU) 321/2011).In an updated 2020 recommendation regarding exposure to PFAS chemicals through food, the EFSA recommended a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 4.4 ng/kg body weight per week for the sum of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA and PFHxS [However, the Endocrine Society, in a recent publication from 2024, together with IPEN (International Pollutants Elimination Network) states that High molecular weight phthalates (HighMWP) are used in the manufacture of PVC, which is found in food packaging and medical devices, as well as in equipment used for food processing. Food stored/prepared/served in plastic containers is therefore an important source of exposure to phthalates. HighMWP are lipophilic and therefore concentrate in high fat foods like meat, fatty fish and high-fat dairy products.Increased migration of phthalates and bisphenols from plastic into food and beverages is associated with heating, duration of heating, and prolonged use of plastic containers [Leaching of toxic additives from plastic to food and beverages and how to reduce exposure. Citations:; Leaching [Migration of PFAS into food is promoted by high fat content of the food, low pH (i.e. acidic food), high salt concentration and emulsified food [Vegetables and fruits are generally thought by the public to be free from EDCs. However, ready-to-eat vegetables, when packaged in plastic wrap, have been found to be a source of exposure to phthalates. In addition, canned fruits and vegetables can be a source of exposure to EDCs due to food contact with the lining of the cans.Rudel studied the effect of switching from a usual diet which included packaged and canned foods to a fresh food diet, with no packaged or canned foods [Fast foods, as well as restaurant food, can be a source of exposure to EDCs. They can migrate into ingredients of food during their manufacture, storage or shipping in plastic containers, or during their preparation in the restaurant. They can also be found in food packaging used for take-away food, such as plastic food containers and wrappers.A study performed in Israel in 2011\\u20132012 found measurable concentrations of selected POPs in breast milk of Israeli mothers, including PBDE, an EDC which is added to plastic as a flame retardant [In a study of urinary concentrations of BPA and phthalate metabolites in 250 Israel adults performed in 2011, detectable levels of BPA were found in 89% while detectable levels of phthalate metabolites were found in over 92%, although the concentrations found for both EDCs were below health-based threshold values at the time of the study [In another Israeli study performed in 2015\\u20132016, BPA and phthalates, measured in urinary samples, were obtained from 50 pregnant Israeli women. BPA was above the level of detection in 98%, and BPF and BPS were above the level of detection in 51% and 27%, respectively. Several phthalate metabolites were detected in 98%-100% of the samples [Phthalates and BPA (along with trace metals and BFR) were found in a survey of soft, flexible plastic children's toys, non-PVC toys and plastic products in contact with infants such as diaper-changing mats, mattresses, feeding chairs, baby feeding aprons, baths and textiles. 65% and 10% of the items tested for two phthalates, DEHP and DINP, respectively, were found above the levels of detection (LOD), with 15% and 7%, respectively exceeding EU standards. BPA was above LOD in 22% of the items, with 17% exceeding EU migration standards for BPA. Only 1 toy, purchased on-line from India, was found to contain\\u00a0phthalates and BPA in levels exceeding EU standards [Tordjman and colleagues studied dietary 24-h recall and urinary levels of EDCs in a pilot study of adult residents of a vegetarian community in Israel [In an important review article, Berman et al. documented worrisome trends in reproductive health in Israel, with increasing rates of testicular cancer, decrease in age of menarche, increase in male infertility and decreasing sperm counts [Israel is a global and regional plastic pollution \\u2018hotspot\\u2019, with a continuously growing rate of single-use plastic (SUP) consumption alongside increasing pollution in public spaces and the natural environment [Plastic pollution in Israel. Citations: [The total amount of plastic waste created in Israel increased by nearly 16% between 2010 and 2016 and is now estimated between 900,000\\u20131,000,000 metric tons per year [Israel has the sixth highest rate of SUP consumption in the world, with a 2019 average of 55 kg /year/per resident [The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a worldwide increase in the use of SUP to minimize contagion risks [Plastic makes up to 41% of the domestic waste volume in Israel and 54% of it ends up in landfills [The rivers in Israel are important contributors to marine pollution [The connection between plastic trash discarded into the environment and human health is not intuitive. We present here 4 major pathways for plastic pollution to affect human health. (See Table\\u00a0The connection between plastic trash discarded into the environment and human exposure to MNP, toxic additives and contaminants to plasticAPlastic pollution can be seen in landfills of plastic trash, as well as in piles of trash thrown in public spaces such as parks, beaches and nature preserves. The plastic trash gradually disintegrates, until it breaks down into MNP which pollute the atmosphere and contaminate the air we breathe. Other causes of the release of MNP into the atmosphere are more subtle: MNP created by abrasion of tires on roads, released into the atmosphere by ocean spray [BPlastic trash thrown into public spaces also enables leaching of toxic chemicals from the plastic into the ground, and from there into ground water, often used as a source of drinking water [CEnvironmental plastic pollution causes fish, shellfish and marine salt to become contaminated with MNP and toxic chemicals. These enter the global food chain, and, if ingested by people, can have adverse effects on our health [DThe high levels of plastic pollution from SUPs indicate that much plastic is being produced in an unstainable way\\u2014Use Once and Throw Away. The cumulative amount of plastic produced since the first synthesis of plastic is estimated at 9.5 billion tons as of 2019 and predicted to increase to 34 billion tons by 2050 [The international community is tackling the increasing threat of plastic pollution to human health and the environment. In March 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) adopted a resolution to launch negotiations for a new international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution: The Plastic Treaty. It will be negotiated by the International Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution [The goal of the Plastic Treaty is to comprehensively address plastics and their additives throughout their entire lifecycle, from production to disposalSee Table\\u00a0International Conventions that directly address plastic waste and hazardous chemicals found in plasticsThe Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their DisposalThe Basel Convention regulates and controls the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, including plastic waste. It prohibits the export of hazardous wastes from developed countries to developing countries, unless the receiving country explicitly consents to the import. The Basel Convention also sets standards for the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes, both domestically and internationally [The Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International TradeThe Rotterdam Convention regulates the international trade and safe use of certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides, including those that are used as monomers, additives, or processing aids in the production of certain plastics (It requires countries to notify each other before exporting these chemicals, and to obtain the prior informed consent (PIC) of the importing country before exporting them for first-time use. In 2019, the Parties to the Convention adopted a decision on measures to reduce the generation of plastic waste and improve its management including: promoting the use of sustainable alternatives to plastic; improving waste collection and recycling; reducing the export of plastic waste to countries that are not equipped to manage it safely [The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)The Stockholm Convention regulates chemicals that are considered persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBTs), with potentially harmful effects on human health and the environment. The Convention prohibits and restricts the use of POP additives in plastics (e.g., POPs used as flame retardants, plasticizers, or surfactants), and restricts releases of unintentional POPs (UPOPs), deriving, The London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other MatterThe London Convention prohibits the dumping of hazardous wastes at sea. It includes stringent controls on the dumping of hazardous wastes, including plastic waste, that are likely: a) to sink to the sea bottom and remain there; b) to float or remain in suspension in the sea and interfere with navigation, fishing or other legitimate uses of the sea; c) to harm human health or marine life [OECD member countries are taking various policy and regulatory actions to address plastic pollution [Plastics strategy and action of key OECD membersCountries in the European Union (EU)JapanCanadaUSACalifornia has banned SUP bags and implemented extended producer responsibility programs for plastic packaging [Israel has established legal framework and policies to manage plastic waste, microplastics, and their additives. We highlight key laws below.The 1984 \\\"Maintenance of Cleanliness Law\\\" [Section 10 of the Law establishes the \\\"Maintenance of Cleanliness\\\" Fund, managed by the Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP), whose primary objective is the earmarking of financial resources for environmental protection activities in Israel, such as promotion of clean beaches, prevention of unauthorized waste disposal, and the treatment and recycling of waste. The Fund also addresses pollution caused by hazardous waste, such as asbestos and hazardous dust, which pose health risks.One of the underlying environmental policy principles implemented in Israel is an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), under which a producer\\u2019s responsibility for a product is extended to the post-consumer stage of a product\\u2019s life cycle. This imposes responsibility on manufacturers and importers regarding environmental damage caused by their products, during the product\\u2019s entire life cycle. According to the principle of EPR, the negative environmental costs and the costs of dealing with waste, including collection, sorting and recycling of a discarded product, are reflected in the product price [In Israel, there are several EPR legislative measures, including laws specifically targeting reduction in plastic pollution and promoting sustainable practices. Below are four key laws related to plastic use and waste in Israel, which are currently in force (See Table\\u00a0Current Israeli EPR Laws addressing plastic pollutionThis Law (also known as \\u2018The Bottle Bill\\u2019) requires a refundable deposit to be paid on beverage containers sold in Israel, thereby promoting reuse and recycling of beverage containers, and reduction of litter in public spaces and of waste in landfills. It regulates the recycling of beverage cans and bottles made of glass, metal, and plastic with volumes ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 L. Consumers pay a deposit fee upon purchase, which is refunded upon returning empty containers. The funds collected through the law go to the MoEP Cleanliness Fund and are used to promote beverage container recycling and enforcement of environmental legislation [This law aims to reduce the use of SUP bags, thereby reducing the amount of waste generated and its negative environmental impact. The law requires supermarkets (at the check-out counter) to charge a fee for SUP bags. The law promotes alternatives to SUP and encourages recycling [The Packaging Law places responsibility for the collection and recycling of a product's packaging waste directly upon that product's manufacturers and importers. The Law\\u2019s main goal is reduction of the negative environmental impact of consumer product packaging and prevent its landfilling, by encouraging recycling of plastic packaging of food, personal care and household cleaning products, as well as nylon bags, milk and juice cartons and empty tins of canned food. Orange plastic trash collection bins are placed in each municipal\\u00a0neighborhood by the municipality, which also pays for transport of the bins to a central processing center. It focuses on minimizing packaging waste generation, preventing its accumulation, and promoting packaging reuse [This Law\\u00a0regulates the disposal and recycling of tires to protect the environment and prevent harm caused by discard of tires in unregulated sites, uncontrolled burning and landfill accumulation. This law places the responsibility for tire recycling on tire producers and importers. Tire producers and importers in Israel are responsible for collecting used tires and either recycling them or finding other ways to reuse them [Israeli Standard 5113 is an official regulation in Israel that is based on EU regulations and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for certifying the safety of food- and beverage- contact plastic [This standard requires testing of products based on their intended use, such as microwave heating, contact with hot or cold food, or prolonged storage. The tests are designed to assess the general migration of substances from the plastic material, as well as the specific migration of hazardous substances that may pose risks to human health. This includes heavy metals like lead, copper, iron, nickel, aluminum, as well as potentially harmful organic compounds and carcinogens.Additional important regulations: Feeding bottles for infants\\u2014Standard 5817; Pacifiers for children\\u2014Standard 1157; Feeding accessories for children\\u2014Standard 14,372; Children's jewelry\\u2014Standard 6558.Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) play a significant role in reducing plastic pollution and exposure to plastic additives in Israel. They operate individually on many levels: education; advocacy; research; policy. Many environmental NGOs have joined the Israeli Plastic Pollution Prevention Coalition (IPPPC), which facilitates cooperation and consensus building on important initiatives.Together and individually, NGOs educate the public about the negative impacts of plastic pollution, promote alternative, environmentally friendly products, organize beach cleanups and campaigns to remove plastic waste from the environment.

In the absence of post-exposure measures, effective policy interventions need to emphasis prevention of exposure to MNP and toxic additives to plastic.Proposed interventions, their implementation and management, require a multi-faceted approach involving government, industry, NGOs, academia, and the public at the local, regional and national levels.

For food and beverage containers, labelling should include the safe temperature to which they can be heated without danger that toxic chemicals may leach into the food/beverage8An official website of an authoritative governmental body should be established, providing information about safe use of food-, beverage-, and child-contact plastics, with explanations about the labelling on plastic products, and a clear recommendation against heating or serving hot food and beverages in any plastic container unless it is certified as food-safe and not used at a temperature above that recommended by the manufacturerThe public should be advised to avoid buying cosmetics, body care products, cleaning products or glitter containing MNP or microplastic beads (as long as there is no ban on their sale)The website should be regularly updated and have a call center or chatbot that will allow the public to ask questions9Public awareness campaigns should be launched, to educate the public and encourage behavioral changes to reduce exposuresNational and local health promotion campaigns are needed to promote safe use of plastic and encourage use of alternatives to plastic, such as glass, wood, metal, ceramics, fabrics from natural materials10Special health promotion programs should be implemented for those populations most likely to have exposure to MNPs or toxic additives to plastic which can affect their health or that of their children: pregnant mothers, infants and children, as well as both members of a couple who are trying to conceive.

They are used in the manufacture of epoxy resins which are used to line food and beverage cans. They can leach from food and drink containers into the food we eat and the beverages we drink [The vast majority of the population of the world is exposed to bisphenol A (BPA). The half-life of BPA in the human body is short (approximately 6 h). In a study by the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), over 92% of Americans were found to have detectable levels of BPA in their urine, reflecting ubiquitous exposure to BPA. Measurable levels of BPA have been found in maternal and fetal blood and placenta and in the milk of nursing mothers [Phthalates are plasticizersThe source of phthalates in meat and dairy products can be from exposure to phthalates in animals from which meat and dairy products are made, thereby allowing phthalates to enter the human food chain through the food itself, as well as through phthalates in the plastic packaging in which meat, fish and dairy products are marketed [The phthalate DEHP is widely used in medical care products since DEHP is an integral part of the PVC which is used for the manufacture of intravenous bags, tubing, dialysis equipment, and surgical gloves.Phthalates have a short half-life in the human body since they are rapidly metabolized and excreted in the urine. Surveys in the US have found that virtually everyone is exposed to phthalates on a daily basis. DEHP and its metabolites are present in 90\\u2013100% of samples of second-trimester amniotic fluid and are also found in cord blood of newborns, breast milk and ovarian follicular fluid [PFAS have grease- and water-resistant properties and are therefore found in many consumer products as additives to plastics such as polyester, nylon and vinyl fabrics, which are widely used for the manufacture of clothes, rugs, cushions, drapes and textile-covered furniture. Disintegration of these plastics allows for the creation of microfibers containing PFAS, which can be a source of human exposure to PFAS via inhalation or oral contact. PFAS can often be found in coatings of nonstick cookware, wrappers for take-away food, as well as many other consumer items. They can be found as additives to industrial equipment for the manufacture of food items and/or plastic bins in which food is stored or shipped. Since PFAS do not bind to plastic, they can migrate easily from plastic to food and beverages. PFAS has been found in some \\\"biodegradable\\\" bowls that are marketed as safe replacements for plastic bowls.Due to their wide-spread use, PFAS chemicals are now ubiquitous, both in the environment and in the general population.

They are chemicals called xenohormones whose structure is similar to that of naturally occurring human endocrine hormones (EDCs have biological effects throughout the life cycle, from the fetus, throughout infancy and childhood, adolescence, adulthood and aging [Of particular concern is the increasing evidence of multi-generational effects of exposure to EDCs. Exposure of a pregnant woman to EDCs can affect the health of her fetus, not only in utero but also during the growth and development of her newborn infant throughout childhood and adolescence and even into adulthood [Maternal exposure to EDCs can also affect the development of a male fetus. Maternal occupational exposure to EDCs during pregnancy has been found to be associated with poor sperm quality and concentrations in their adult sons [The Endocrine Society's Authoritative Guide emphasizes that adverse health effects of exposure to EDCs can occur at very low doses and that therefore there is likely no \\\"safe\\\" dose of exposure to EDCs. The Guide also emphasizes that there can be a long latency between exposure to EDCs and adverse health effects [The Endocrine Society [Bisphenol A (BPA), F (BPF) and S (BPS) are those bisphenols for which there is the most evidence of adverse health effects [In adults, exposure to BPA and BPS is associated with increased risk of diabetes. In children, prenatal exposure to BPA is associated with increased levels of body fat, ADHD and behavior problems [Due to all the adverse health effects associated with BPA, it has been classified by the REACH regulation of the EU as a substance of very high concern (SVHC) [Exposure to BPA and its analogs (BPF, BPS, BPAF, TBBPA) negatively affect reproductive health of women [Analogs are increasingly used as substitutes for BPA, which has been banned in baby bottles, baby \\\"sipping\\\" cups and pacifiers in many countries. Since these analogs resemble BPA in their structure, there is growing concern that these substitutes for BPA may also affect the human reproductive system [Phthalates affect estrogen and testosterone levels and function, and block thyroid action. They are therefore considered to be reproductive toxicants and classified by the EU as SVHC.Prenatal exposure to phthalates is associated with preterm birth [A recent analysis was performed of prospective studies of the associations between prenatal exposure to phthalates (as measured by gestational maternal urinary phthalates DEHP, DiDP, DnOP and DiNP) and birth outcomes (gestational age at birth, birthweight, birth length and birthweight-for-gestational age Z-scores) in 5006 mother\\u2013child dyads in 13 cohorts of diverse populations in the United States.

Exposure to the phthalate DEHP is associated with increased risk of endometriosis [In adult men, chronic exposure to phthalates (especially benzyl and butyl phthalates) is associated with decreased testosterone levels, decreased sperm counts and sperm quality, resulting in a decrease in male fertility. A cross-sectional study of fertile men in the US, found an association between urinary MBzP concentrations and decreased sperm motility [In adults, both male and female, exposure to phthalates is associated with obesity, diabetes, and other risk factors for CVD, including elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance and elevated levels of triglycerides [In 2015 the Endocrine Society published a review of endocrine disrupting effects of EDCs [Prenatal exposure to PFAS is associated with low birth weight and childhood obesity. Exposure during pregnancy is also associated with impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in the mother [In adult males, PFAS exposure is associated with lower semen quality and semen counts [Some of the PFAS chemicals are carcinogenic [PFOA was classified as a human carcinogen in 2023 [PFOS was classified in 2023 as a possible human carcinogen [The testing of the toxicity of EDCs requires analysis of endocrine effects at various doses, for various periods of times, in multiple organs of exposed laboratory animals (compared with controls), as well as study of carcinogenesis. Study of the effects of maternal exposure of laboratory animals to EDCs on their offsrping includes analysis of congenital defects, growth and development (physical, neuro-behavioral, endocrinological and sexual), epigenetic effects, carcinogenesis and second-generation effects. The EDC being tested is administered to the laboratory animal at various doses, and given at various phases of pregnancy.For a good example, see Stahl's review on the toxicology of PFAS [For example, The EU has classified the NOAEL for reproductive and development effects of the phthalate DEHP as 4.8\\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day and the TDI (tolerable daily intake) as 0.05\\u00a0mg/kg BW/day [For bisphenols, in 2023 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) lowered its recommendations for TDI for BPA to 0.2 nanograms/kg of BW/day, a level 20,000 times lower than the TDI recommended previously in their report of 2015, based on a review of 800 new publications. The EU has also taken steps to decrease exposure to BPA via food contact materials, by setting a Specific Migration Limit (SML) of 0.05 mg of bisphenol A per kilogram of food (Regulation (EU) 2018/213), along with a ban on BPA in the manufacture of polycarbonate baby bottles (Regulation (EU) 321/2011).In an updated 2020 recommendation regarding exposure to PFAS chemicals through food, the EFSA recommended a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 4.4 ng/kg body weight per week for the sum of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA and PFHxS [However, the Endocrine Society, in a recent publication from 2024, together with IPEN (International Pollutants Elimination Network) states that \"}, {\"section\": \"(1) Bisphenols\", \"body\": \"Bisphenols are used in the manufacture of single-use and multiple-use polycarbonate bottles for beverages, containers for the storage of food, kitchen utensils, toys, dental sealants and even water pipes.

The topic covers a wide variety of exposure risks that vary by types of plastic and their additives, leaching of toxic additives out of plastics into beverages, food, and textiles, along with the non-degradable nature of plastic, causing its fragmentation into Microplastic (1 micron-5\\u00a0mm) and Nanoplastic (1\\u00a0nm-1 micron), collectively known as MNP. These MNP spread throughout our environment, contaminating the atmosphere, water, and land of the earth, allowing MNP to work its way up through the food chain, disrupting global ecology. Humans can be exposed to MNP via inhalation, ingestion and touch, while fetuses can be exposed via maternal exposure and infants can be exposed through breast milk.However, it is difficult to establish causality, rather than associations, between exposure and adverse health effects [The growing number of studies documenting the presence of MNP in various organs of the human body are a cause for concern, since they are indestructible by any biological process. Therefore, once present in human tissue, they are likely to persist. The recent findings of MNP on the fetal side of the human placenta, meconium of new-born infants, breast milk, the circulatory and digestive systems, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, testes, and sperm are particularly worrisome.Over their lifespan, infants and children will accumulate a much larger body burden of MNP than adults who were born decades ago, given the current exponential rate of increase in production of plastic and their longer potential years of exposure. However, exposure does not mean that the MNP will pass the epithelial barriers of the lungs, GI systems and skin and adversely affect health. Much more research needs to be done on this topic [The urgency of our problem of exposure to MNP is emphasized by the decision of the European Commission, in September 2023, to restrict intentionally-manufactured MP less than 5\\u00a0mm in size, including immediate bans on glitter and microbeads, and to restrict manufacture of granular infill materials manufactured from MP that are found in both artificial grass and \\\"crumb rubber\\\" surfaces [Plastics include many toxic additives, including EDCs, that we chose to review in this article. The toxic effects of exposure to EDCs have been widely researched, in epidemiological studies and animal models. Those studies in which exposure is measured before the adverse outcome (such as those studying the association between levels of EDCs in pregnant mothers and various measures of health, growth and development of her infant) strengthen the evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to EDCs and adverse health effects [There is growing concern about potential adverse reproductive health effects of EDCs at the population level, with decreasing sperm counts, increasing rates of testicular cancer and decreasing age of menarche in the majority of industrialized countries around the world [This article reviews selected EDCs additives to plastics (phthalates, bisphenols and PFAS), which can cause adverse health effects. A recent statement by the Endocrine Society states that a paradigm change is needed regarding exposure to EDCs, since even very low exposure doses can have adverse health effects [The current level of plastic production is non-sustainable and incompatible with public health. In 2021 alone, 390 million metric tons of plastic were produced worldwide [Our integrative review is geared towards promoting awareness of the Israeli public and policy makers to the growing threat of adverse effects to our health due to exposure to plastics, MNP, and their additives. It is difficult, however, to accurately assess the exact risk to human health, since all populations are universally exposed to both MNP and EDCs, measurements of exposure are difficult, and health consequences of exposure may appear only after years. EDCs can exert effects at very low doses compared to traditional chemicals, raising questions about the existence of a safe threshold of exposure.

We summarize the existing evidence for harmful effects to human health in this paper.Our paper develops the case for applying the Precautionary Principle to slow and eventually stop the rapid increase in our exposure to plastic, MNP and their additives. The Precautionary Principle is a pro-active policy-making framework that prioritizes early intervention when there are threats of serious or irreversible damage to health or the environment, even when there is lack of full scientific certainty about potential harm. Delaying a policy decision until there is absolute scientific certainty cannot be used as a reason for postponing intervention [In Sect.\\u00a0\\\"Israel has few standards and little enforcement of the quality of plastic that is manufactured, imported, or recycled and few labelling requirements.

However, there is still no effective way to consistently boost mucosal IgA responses, and the factors influencing these responses are not fully understood. We observed that colonization with the murine intestinal symbiotic protozoan Tritrichomonas musculis ( T.mu ) boosted antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. This enhancement was attributed to the accumulation of free arachidonic acid (ARA) in the intestinal lumen, which served as a signal to stimulate the production of antigen-specific mucosal IgA. When ARA was prevented from undergoing its downstream metabolic transformation using the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton or by blocking its downstream biological signaling through genetic deletion of the Leukotriene B_4 receptor 1 ( Blt1 ), the T.mu -mediated enhancement of antigen-specific mucosal IgA production was suppressed. Moreover, both T.mu transfer and dietary supplementation of ARA augmented the efficacy of an oral vaccine against Salmonella infection, with this effect being dependent on Blt1. Our findings elucidate a tripartite circuit linking nutrients from the diet or intestinal microbiota, host lipid metabolism, and the mucosal humoral immune response.\", \"Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is an important part of the mucosal immune response.

Both dietary and microbiota-derived free ARA are fundamental for mammalian health. ARA has been found to suppress pyrin inflammasome activation by activating the serine-threonine kinases PKNsOur findings indicate that dietary supplementation with ARA can effectively enhance antigen-specific IgA responses. Interestingly, previous research has revealed that the diurnal rhythmicity of intestinal IgA secretion aligns with the timing of food consumptionAlthough our study provides valuable insights, it also has certain limitations. We primarily utilized intraperitoneal and oral vaccination models in mice, and further investigation is needed to assess the translational potential of our findings in human mucosal vaccinations, particularly by manipulating dietary or microbial nutrients and host metabolic activities. Additionally, future studies are warranted to explore whether the ARA 5-ALOX pathway and Blt1 signaling play a role in promoting antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses in humans. These avenues of research will be crucial for advancing our understanding of strategies to restore mucosal homeostasis, particularly in the context of intestinal infection and inflammation.\"}, {\"section\": \"Methods\", \"body\": \"All animal work was conducted with the approval of the Animal Care Committee of Xuzhou Medical University.

Biodiversity can constrain the spread of vector-borne pathogens circulation, necessitating a deeper understanding of ecological mechanisms underlying this pattern. Our study evaluates the relative importance of biodiversity and the abundance of Bulinus truncatus , a major intermediate host for the trematode Schistosoma haematobium on the circulation of this human pathogen at aquatic transmission sites.\", \"Methods\", \"We combined mathematical modelling and a molecular based empirical study to specifically assess the effect of co-infections between S. haematobium and other trematodes within their B. truncatus snail hosts; and B. truncatus abundance at transmission sites, on the production of S. haematobium infective cercariae stages released into the aquatic environment.\", \"Results\", \"Our modelling approach shows that more competitive trematode species exploiting B. truncatus as an intermediate host at the transmission site level leads to higher co-infection rates within snail hosts, subsequently reducing the production of S. haematobium cercariae. Conversely, an increase in B. truncatus abundance results in lower co-infection rates, and a higher proportion of S. haematobium cercariae released into the environment. Our empirical data from the field support these findings, indicating a significant negative effect of local trematode species richness ( P -value\\u2009=\\u20090.029; AIC\\u2009=\\u200914.9) and co-infection rates ( P -value\\u2009=\\u20090.02, AIC\\u2009=\\u200917.4) on the dominance of S. haematobium based on our GLMM models, while B. truncatus abundance positively influences S. haematobium dominance ( P -value\\u2009=\\u20090.047, AIC\\u2009=\\u200920.1).\", \"Conclusions\", \"Our study highlights the importance of biodiversity in influencing the transmission of S. haematobium through the effect of antagonistic interactions between trematodes within bulinid snail hosts.

We surmised that this was likely due to the notoriously high error rates of nanopore reads, as well as the general lack of specialised programs that can process such erroneous reads. Existing nanopore metabarcoding workflows either incorporate complicated and time-consuming laboratory steps, or require custom reference databases, or additional polishing steps, which perhaps disincentives the use of nanopore sequencing for metabarcoding. However, recent improvements in nanopore read accuracy in conjunction with new bioinformatic pipelines have led us to posit that nanopore sequencing can now produce highly-accurate metabarcoding results that are consistent with conventional Illumina sequencing, and without the need to polish the sequences unlike in the past.

The plant microbiome is one of the key factors affecting plant growth. The plant microbiome is comprised of a diverse array of microorganisms. These microorganisms interact with plants in various ways, commensally, beneficially, or pathogenically, and engage in competitive or synergistic interactions. Harnessing the plant microbiome to promote plant growth offers significant potential as an environmentally friendly approach to meet the increasing food demands of the world's growing population and to mitigate the environmental and societal challenges of large-scale food productionThus, the plant microbiome can be used as an effective strategy for increasing plant growth. However, altering the microbiome to promote plant growth remains challenging. Despite numerous studies highlighting the disease suppression and plant growth-promoting abilities of the rhizosphere microbiome, the field application of these findings remains limited. Consequently, further research into the dynamic interactions between crop plants, rhizosphere microbiome, and environment is essential for effectively utilizing the microbiome to increase crop yield and qualityThe results of this study suggest that microbial inoculation, which increases the negative co-occurrence of certain taxa, can promote plant growth.

Domestication leads to phenotypic changes over generations, sometimes from the very first generation. Behavioral traits are among the first to change. However, in fish, potential behavioral changes during early domestication have been little studied. Therefore, we studied potential behavioral changes among early and advanced levels of domestication in a model species, the zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), using a mirror test experiment, commonly used to assess traits involved in activity, aggressiveness, and stress in this species. We compared these traits between wild zebrafish in captivity (F0; Level 1), the first generation of their captive-born offspring (F1; Level 4), and three laboratory strains (AB, TU, and WIK; Level 5). Each fish was individually filmed and tracked using an automated procedure for 5\\u00a0min. Nine behavioral traits and one activity-related trait were characterized for each individual based on the movements and positioning of the fish. We applied a principal component analysis (PCA) and tested the significance of potential differences between groups using an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM). We applied an indicator value analysis (IndVal) to determine which traits were most expressed by each group. We detected differences between groups and across domestication levels. More specifically, we highlighted differentiations between different levels of domestication (e.g. between F1, AB, TU, and WIK) as early as the beginning of the domestication process (i.e. F0 vs . F1), but also within the same level of domestication (i.e. AB vs . TU). Based on PCA and IndVal, (i) F0 and F1 tended to show stronger expression of stress-related traits than the other groups, (ii) F0 was more active than others, and (iii) TU was more aggressive than AB. Our results confirmed that domestication can change fish behavior, even in the first generation born in captivity, although these modifications remain limited. In contrast, we did not observe any general trends correlated with domestication levels, given that AB and TU diverged in their aggressiveness levels, and WIK differed only from F1. This result needs to be generalized to other species but also considered for domestication for aquaculture. If future studies confirm that the changes observed at the beginning of the domestication process remain limited and that there is no consistent evolutionary trend across generations in fish, this would highlight the crucial importance of selecting the right species from the outset of domestication. It would also emphasize the need to design selective breeding programs that shape fish stocks with the most desirable characteristics. To our knowledge, this study is one of the few to examine the behavior of wild zebrafish alongside laboratory strains, offering a unique insight into the early stages of domestication.\"}}, \"content\": [{\"section\": \"Introduction\", \"body\": \"Domestication is a mutualistic relationship in which one species (the \\\"domesticator\\\"; e.g. humans) provides lasting, multigenerational support to another (the \\\"domesticate\\\") in exchange for a predictable supply of a resource or services in a captive environment more or less controlled by the domesticator (adapted fromDuring domestication, a population of a species (the domesticate) adapts through phenotypic modifications, over generations, to the captive environment and to human control of its resources and life cycleUnderstanding the consequences of domestication is important for fish production in aquaculture.

Although the test used is regarded as appropriate (see materials and methods for details), a combination of several tests would capture a wider range of behavioral traits. For instance, a more comprehensive assessment of the consequences of domestication on zebrafish behavior should add (i) open-field tests to assess general activity and anxious behaviorSecond, although our study considered three important levels of domestication, it only studied populations with few or many generations spent in captivity (i.e. F0 and F1 Third, the model species, rearing system, and mirror test design can provide insight for some species phylogenetically related (e.g. Cyprinid, widely used in aquacultureFourth, this study was conducted with a relatively small number of individuals from a single wild population for the F0 and F1 strains, which limits the scope of our findings. Drawing broad conclusions from this single wild population may not accurately reflect what occurs in other populations. However, the challenges involved in sampling, acclimating, and maintaining wild zebrafish in captivity make this limitation difficult to overcome. These challenges have led previous studies to avoid using wild zebrafish. Therefore, the results of this study, though constrained by the focus on a single population, provide valuable and rare insights into the early stages of domestication in zebrafish, an area that remains largely unexplored.Beyond the above suggested perspectives to overcome the limitations of this study, future research should investigate the genetic basis and heritability of these behavioral traits (i.e. already known in some speciesFinally, the present study did not directly investigate the consequences of behavioral changes during domestication on fish welfare. Although the reduction of stress over generations is undoubtedly beneficial for welfare, changes in aggressiveness raise questions about the consequences for fish when placed in intensive farming conditions. Therefore, the impact on welfare should be a central focus of future studies on the consequences of domestication\"}, {\"section\": \"Conclusion\", \"body\": \"We studied changes in expression of traits related to activity, aggressiveness, and stress between wild zebrafish and the first generation of their captive-born offspring, as well as with populations more advanced in the domestication process. As already observed in animals, reduction in the expression of stress-related characteristics was observed between groups at different levels of domestication (i.e. decrease with level 5), suggesting potential selection for stress tolerance during the process. However, no general trend was observed for traits related to activity and aggressiveness among groups, potentially highlighting the complex interplay of genetic background and environmental factors in shaping these behaviors under domestication, even within a species in fish. These specificities observed between the studied fish groups question the potential evolutionary convergences or parallels for behavioral traits previously suggestedFuture studies on the consequences of domestication on fish behavior should (i) consider a combination of behavioral assays to capture a wider range of behavioral traits, (ii) limit age divergences between groups or demonstrate that these divergences have little impact on the changes observed between generations, (iii) track the dynamics of changes over time in greater detail by studying a larger number of successive generations, and (iv) investigate the underlying mechanisms driving behavioral changes under domestication.Overall, our study contributes to advancing knowledge in fish behavior and domestication, offering insights that could enhance fish welfare and productivity in aquaculture. By refining our understanding of stress, aggressiveness, and activity responses in zebrafish under domestication, we lay the groundwork for sustainable aquaculture practices that promote resilience and efficiency in global food production systems.\"}]}, {\"meta_data\": {\"content_type\": \"Article\", \"url\": [{\"format\": \"\", \"platform\": \"\", \"value\": \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-71731-6\"}], \"title\": \"Associations between gut microbiota and osteoporosis or osteopenia in a cohort of Chinese Han youth\", \"publication_name\": \"Scientific Reports\", \"doi\": \"10.1038/s41598-024-71731-6\", \"publication_date\": \"2024-09-09\", \"starting_page\": \"1\", \"ending_page\": \"12\", \"open_access\": \"true\", \"abstract\": {\"h1\": \"Abstract\", \"p\": \"Osteoporosis (OP) is a common metabolic bone disease characterized by low bone mass and microstructural deterioration of bone.

Furthermore, according to the T\\u2013score evaluation criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO), we divided the BMD levels of participants into three groups: osteoporosis\\\\BDL, osteopenia\\\\BDM, normal bone density\\\\BDH, and the associations between GM community and BMD groups were conducted. According to alpha and beta diversity analysis, significant differences were found in the microbial richness and composition between groups. The dominant phyla of GM in a cohort of Chinese Han youth were Bacteroidota (50.6%) and Firmicutes (41.6%). Anaerobic microorganisms, such as g_Faecalibacterium and g_Megamonas , account for the largest proportion in the gut, which were mainly Firmicutes phylum. The dominant genera and species in the three BMD groups were g_Prevotella , g_Bacteroides , g_Faecalibacterium , g_Megamonas, s_Prevotella copri , s_unclassified_g_Faecalibacterium , s_unclassified_g_Prevotella , s_unclassified_g_Bacteroides and s_Bacteroides plebeius. g_Faecalibacterium , g_Bacteroides and g_Ruminococcus differed between the BDH and BDL groups as well as between the BDH and BDM groups. LEfSe showed three genus communities and eight species communities were enriched in the three BMD groups, respectively. The associations between microbial relative abundance and T\\u2013score was not statistically significant by Spearman and regression analysis. In conclusion, the alpha diversity indexes in the BDH group were higher than in the BDL group, and several taxa were identified that may be the targets for diagnosis and therapy of OP.\"}}, \"content\": [{\"section\": \"Introduction\", \"body\": \"The gut microbiota (GM) is considered to be a multifunctional \\u201corgan\\u201d, involved in immunity, metabolic regulation and other life activities.

In this study, we investigated the responses of the food web of an upland stream to a CSFO, focusing on the effects of fine sediment deposition detected in three different mesohabitats, i.e., a pool, a riffle, and a step-pool. The field campaign lasted two years and included repeated measurements of fine sediment deposits, and sampling of periphyton, benthic macroinvertebrates and fishes. A moderate and patchy deposition occurred due to the CSFO with short and medium-term ecological impact on the lower trophic levels of the food web, which may affect the whole ecosystem functioning. The monitoring of all available mesohabitats in the investigated stream allowed to detect variations in the ecological response to CSFO, providing a more adequate assessment of the impact. As expected, sedimentation was larger in the pool but, in contrast to our hypotheses, the impact was lower and the recovery was longer for the benthic organisms inhabiting the riffle. In the case of fishes, no lethal impact of both brown trout and bullhead was recorded in the short term but the occurrence of longer lasting effects could not be excluded. To date, this is one of the few studies dealing with a detailed integrative assessment of the downstream impact of sediment management from reservoir on both abiotic and biotic components of stream ecosystem.\"}}, \"content\": [{\"section\": \"Introduction\", \"body\": \"The natural sediment flux is severely reduced by dams, causing loss of reservoirs storage and downstream sediment imbalance, propagating up to the sea shorelinesThe evacuation of fine sediment (d\\u2009<\\u20092\\u00a0mmThe increase in sediment loading during flushing can severely affect the biota in river reaches downstream from the flushed reservoir, at least in the short termA further key issue when considering the potential drawbacks of sediment flushing is represented by excessive sediment deposition, i.e., severe alteration of channel morphology, in the river reaches downstream from the flushed reservoir.

Full recovery of the pre-CSFO standard in terms of fine sediment content of the streambed substrate can be expected within the following year. A similar recovery time can be expected for the biological community, particularly if, as in the study stream, an undisturbed tributary can act as recolonization source. Therefore, more severe impact and longer recovery time may occur in stream reaches not supplied by substantial tributary flow and closer to the flushed reservoir.Detailed monitoring of different mesohabitats evidenced a certain variability in the abiotic (fine sediment deposition per unit area) and biotic response to the CSFO. For instance, if the assessment would have focused only on the step-pool, a larger short-term contraction of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and a faster recovery would have been estimated compared to the riffle. In this perspective, standard monitoring restricted to a single hydro-morphologic unit (mostly riffle) could be integrated by detailed mesohabitat monitoring when the hydro-morphologic characteristics of the receiving stream and the grain-size of the flushed sediment lead to predict significant difference of depositional patterns.The three biological groups investigated in this study responded differently to the CSFO, and their integrated analysis suggests possible effects on the whole ecosystem functioning. Future research is required to improve our comprehension of the effects of CSFOs (and, more generally, of sediment pulses) over stream food webs, possibly increasing temporal resolution, including further components (e.g., POM and terrestrial arthropods), and measuring stream metabolism in terms of respiration and primary productivity.Our study deals with a managed environment. In particular, due to hydropower development, the streamflow is significantly lower than the natural flow, and has reduced seasonal variability. This flow pattern increases the persistence of fine sediment deposits, likely extending recovery times. Though the release of clean water (flushing flow) is commonly implemented after CSFOs as a mitigation measure, the subject is poorly documented so far\"}]}, {\"meta_data\": {\"content_type\": \"Article\", \"url\": [{\"format\": \"\", \"platform\": \"\", \"value\": \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40793-024-00612-2\"}], \"title\": \"Genome-centric metagenomes unveiling the hidden resistome in an anchialine cave\", \"publication_name\": \"Environmental Microbiome\", \"doi\": \"10.1186/s40793-024-00612-2\", \"publication_date\": \"2024-09-09\", \"starting_page\": \"1\", \"ending_page\": \"17\", \"open_access\": \"true\", \"abstract\": {\"h1\": \"Abstract\", \"p\": [\"Background\", \"Antibiotic resistance is a critical global concern, posing significant challenges to human health and medical treatments.

Our initial screening for ARG presence across the 418 MAGs obtained from the depth profile was performed with 3 diverse tools, based on their distinct modes of search for ARG sequences. All strict CARD hits (290) were kept for further analysis, while from the loose hits only those confirmed with DeepARG and/or farGene were selected. This yielded 578 potential ARG sequences from 230 MAGs in the anchialine cave (Table S4). Compared to the overall MAG community, certain exceptions were observed, such as the phylum Aenigmatarchaeota, which lacked any representative carrying ARGs, and Iainiarchaoeta and Nanoarchaeota, with only one detected ARG each (Fig. Among the ARG carriers, 26 phyla were identified, including three from the Archaea domain (Iainarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota, and Thermoplasmatota) (Fig. In terms of classes, ARG-carrying MAGs were assigned to a total of 61 classes. Bacterial classes such as Koll11 (Omnitrophota), Gammaproteobacteria (Pseudomonadota), ABY1 (Patescibacteria), Bacteroidia (Bacteroidota), Alphaproteobacteria (Pseudomonadota), and Paceibacteria (Patescibacteria) collectively carried 61% of all ARG-carrying MAGs in the anchialine environment (Fig. Our analysis revealed a wide range of resistance classes carried by different phyla. Pseudomonadota (Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) were found to carry genes encoding for the resistance against multidrug, fluoroquinolone, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, bacitracin, \\u03b2-lactam, and macrolide-licosamide-streptogramin (MLS). In contrast, Patescibacteria and Omnitrophota had a nearly exclusive prevalence of the glycopeptide resistance class. Indeed, resistance against glycopeptide was the most dominant class (70% of ARG-carrying MAGs), followed by MDR (24% of ARG-carrying MAGs), aminoglycoside (21.7%), and fluoroquinolone/tetracycline (20.9% MAGs) resistance classes (Fig.\\u00a0The association between antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) resistance classes (according to CARD terminology) and taxonomic composition of the microbial community at the phylum level based on the ARG-carrying MAGs.

Archaea are presented as phyla Iainarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota, and Thermoplasmatota.

Of the 578 ARGs identified, the majority (232 ARGs; 40%) were found in Pseudomonadota. These were split between Gammaproteobacteria (27%) and Alphaproteobacteria (13%). Patescibacteria accounted for 77 ARGs (13%), Omnitrophota for 49 ARGs (8.5%), and Desulfobacterota for 45 ARGs (7.8%). All other detected phyla represented less than 7% of the total number of ARG-carrying contigs (Table S4).The top three most abundant ARGs present at all sampling depths were those from the vancomycin resistance gene cluster (Heatmap of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) for six sampling sites (SC1-SC6).

We found that a limited number of MGEs were detected, with 21 ARG-carrying contigs identified as of plasmid origin (3.9% of total contig count), 412 were of chromosomal origin and 105 were unclassified. The plasmid-associated ARGs were primarily attributed to Pseudomonadota and Bacillota (synonym Firmicutes) and primarily involved the antibiotic efflux resistance mechanism.
