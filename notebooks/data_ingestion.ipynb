This viewpoint suggests that there are exciting prospects to reformulate meat products that are produced more sustainably and may also have health benefits by substituting high-protein nonmeat ingredients for some of the meat. Considering these pre-existing conditions, this review critically reviews recent data on extenders from several sources, including pulses, plant-based components, plant byproducts, and unconventional sources. We used the related keywords from Scopus-database without limiting the publishing date. With an emphasis on how these findings may impact the sustainability of meat products, it sees them as a great chance to enhance the functional quality and technological profile of meat. Therefore, to promote sustainability, meat alternatives such as plant-based meat equivalents are being made available. To boost consumer acceptability of these goods, further initiatives should also be developed to enhance the functioning of these innovative food items and increase public knowledge of plant-based meat analogues.'}},\n",

Vitamin status can be affected by diet, supplements, kidney function, medications, and dialysis. Little is known about vitamin requirements in CKD, leading to practice variation. The Pediatric Renal Nutrition Taskforce (PRNT), an international team of pediatric kidney dietitians and pediatric nephrologists, was established to develop evidence-based clinical practice points (CPPs) to address challenges and to serve as a resource for nutritional care. Questions were formulated using PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes), and literature searches undertaken to explore clinical practice from assessment to management of vitamin status in children with CKD stages 2–5, on dialysis and post-transplantation (CKD2-5D&T). The CPPs were developed and finalized using a Delphi consensus approach. We present six CPPs for vitamin management for children with CKD2-5D&T. We address assessment, intervention, and monitoring. We recommend avoiding supplementation of vitamin A and suggest water-soluble vitamin supplementation for those on dialysis. In the absence of evidence, a consistent structured approach to vitamin management that considers assessment and monitoring from dietary, physical, and biochemical viewpoints is needed. Careful consideration of the impact of accumulation, losses, comorbidities, and medications needs to be explored for the individual child and vitamin before supplementation can be considered. When supplementing, care needs to be taken not to over-prescribe. Research recommendations are suggested.'}},\n",

       "   'p': 'This study aimed to investigate the impact of varying proportions of dry bean powder on the rheological properties of oil-in-water emulsions. Emulsions were formulated utilizing xanthan gum or dry bean powder across a range of concentrations, including 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Additionally, a control emulsion (CTR) was formulated using xanthan gum exclusively. The rheological properties of the resulting emulsions, both linear and nonlinear, were characterized. Moreover, the correlation between microstructural attributes and the interfacial rheological response within these emulsion systems was thoroughly examined. A prominent observation was the occurrence of shear thinning, characterized by a reduction in viscosity under applied shear stress. Notably, the control emulsion (CTR) displayed the lowest interfacial viscosity values, whereas emulsions incorporating increasing proportions of dry bean powder demonstrated a proportional rise in interfacial viscosity. The highest consistency coefficient and apparent viscosity was recorded in the 7%DB sample with a value of 3.23\\xa0Pa.sn and 0.56\\xa0Pa.s, respectively. This suggests that emulsions formulated with dry bean powder may yield a more resilient interfacial film, attributed to the protein content inherent in dry beans. The establishment of a viscoelastic interfacial layer facilitated by dry bean powder in appropriate concentrations significantly contributes to the long-term stability of the emulsion. Unraveling the intricate relationship between interfacial behaviors holds paramount importance in advocating for the utilization of dry bean powder as a plant-based protein source. In conclusion, the incorporation of dry bean powder enhances the formation of interfacial films in O/W emulsions.'}},\n",

Dual RNA-sequencing transcriptomes of infected nuclei isolated using laser-capture microdissection revealed that ‘ Candidatus Endonucleobacter’ does not obtain most of its nutrition from nuclear DNA or RNA. Instead, ‘ Candidatus Endonucleobacter’ upregulates genes for importing and digesting sugars, lipids, amino acids and possibly mucin from its host. It likely prevents apoptosis of host cells by upregulating 7–13 inhibitors of apoptosis, proteins not previously seen in bacteria. Comparative phylogenetic analyses revealed that ‘ Ca .

Untargeted metabolomics was used to study breast milk from 31 healthy participants to assess the shared metabolites in milk from participants with various backgrounds and understand how different demographic, health, and environmental factors impact the milk metabolome. Breast milk samples were analyzed by four separate UPLC-MS/MS methods. Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis was used to study the most and least variable metabolites. The associations between participant factors and the metabolome were assessed with redundancy analyses. Among all 31 participants and between each untargeted UPLC-MS/MS method, 731 metabolites were detected, of which 389 were shared among all participants. Of the shared metabolites, lactose was the least and lactobionate the most variable metabolite. In the biological super pathway analysis, xenobiotics were the most variable metabolites. Infant age, maternal age, number of live births, and pre-pregnancy BMI were associated with the milk metabolome. In conclusion, the most variable metabolites originate from environmental exposures while the well-conserved core metabolites are linked to cell metabolism or are crucial for infant nutrition and osmoregulation. Understanding the variability of the breast milk metabolome can help identify components that are crucial for infant nutrition, growth, and development.'}},\n",

Age-related shifts in gut microbial communities were identified, with increased abundances of Bacteroidia and Desulfobacteria, unveiling potential microbial proxies for age estimation crucial for fisheries management.

       "   'p': 'Selenium (Se) is essential for human and animal nutrition, playing a key role in antioxidant and immune functions. Organic Se is better for supplementation because it is more efficiently assimilated and less toxic than its inorganic form. Due to the scarcity of Se in European soils, supplementation in feed and food is necessary. Currently, inorganic Se (sodium selenite and selenate) and organic Se in Se-enriched yeast are approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to address Se deficiency. However, Se-enriched microalgae present a promising alternative. By supplementing their growth media with Se, microalgae convert it into organic forms like Se-cysteine and Se-methionine, creating Se-enriched biomass. This biomass can serve as a valuable Se source with the additional benefits of microalgae. This review evaluates the viability of microalgae as a Se supplementation vehicle in food and feed and explores its commercial applications in the European Union (EU), along with emerging projects and innovations in the field.'}},\n",

       "   'p': 'Multicultural cities in the Global North are rapidly developing and releasing urban food policies that outline municipal visions of sustainable food systems. In turn, these policies shape conceptions of food citizenship in the city. While these policies largely absorb activities previously associated with “alternative” food\\xa0systems, little is known about how they respond to critical food and race scholars who have noted that these food practices and spaces have historically marginalized immigrants. A critical discourse analysis of 22 urban food policies from Global North cities reveals that most policies do not meaningfully consider immigrant foodscapes, foodways, and food-related labour. Many promote hegemonic and/or ethno-nationalistic understandings of “healthy” and “sustainable” food without recognizing immigrants’ food-related knowledge and skills. Policies largely fail to connect the topic of immigrant labour with goals like shortening supply chains, subject immigrant neighbourhoods to stigmatizing health discourses, and lack acknowledgement of the barriers immigrants may face to participating in sustainable food systems. Relatedly, policy discourses articulate forms of food citizenship that emphasize individual obligations over rights related to food. This jeopardizes the potential for immigrants to be seen as belonging to dominant political urban food communities and benefitting from the symbolic and material rewards associated with them.'}},\n",

However, plastisphere mycobiome, particularly in terrestrial environments, remains largely unexplored. We conducted a comparative analysis of soil and plastisphere fungal communities using 125 experimental microcosms. Our results revealed distinct taxonomic structures between these two environments, with the genera Penicillium and pathogenic Alternaria being specifically enriched in the plastisphere. In comparison with soil communities, plastisphere communities exhibited weaker associations with environmental variables. Stochastic processes were found to be primary drivers of plastisphere fungal community assembly. Limited dispersal of fungal communities on soil microplastics was obtained, suggesting potential implications for taxa isolation or even diversity loss. The expanding plastisphere would pose critical planetary ecology challenges. Our findings highlight plastisphere act as unique niches for fungal communities that are less influenced by environmental variables, providing new insights into the ecology of the soil plastisphere.',\n",

This viewpoint suggests that there are exciting prospects to reformulate meat products that are produced more sustainably and may also have health benefits by substituting high-protein nonmeat ingredients for some of the meat. Considering these pre-existing conditions, this review critically reviews recent data on extenders from several sources, including pulses, plant-based components, plant byproducts, and unconventional sources. We used the related keywords from Scopus-database without limiting the publishing date. With an emphasis on how these findings may impact the sustainability of meat products, it sees them as a great chance to enhance the functional quality and technological profile of meat. Therefore, to promote sustainability, meat alternatives such as plant-based meat equivalents are being made available. To boost consumer acceptability of these goods, further initiatives should also be developed to enhance the functioning of these innovative food items and increase public knowledge of plant-based meat analogues.'}},\n",

We aimed to evaluate the attraction efficiency of two flow-refuges differing in their approaching angles, for Luciobarbus bocagei at an indoor experimental flume. We tested two flow-refuge insertion angles (45° and 70°), and two flow events (base 7\\xa0L/s and pulsed-flow 60\\xa0L/s) for each. To analyze flow-refuge efficiency, we quantified fish individual and group patterns, flow-refuge use, and permanence time, while measuring glucose and lactate responses. The results showed that the individual frequency of use during simulated pulsed-flow was higher, especially on the 45° flow-refuge. The simulated pulsed-flow condition did not disrupt group behavior for both approaching angles. Glucose and lactate analysis did not trigger physiological responses in the tested trials. The 45° flow-refuge was used more often than the 70°. The narrowing of the channel caused by the 45° flow-refuge, and the consequent higher flow homogeneity increased the attractiveness of the flow-refuge. Therefore, the flow-refuge insertion angle should be a decisive criterion in the construction and installation of flow-refuges for cyprinids, and be considered a potential indirect mitigation measure.'}}]"

Generally, meat analogues are developed from defatted protein sources that result in lesser fat content in the meat analogues. Therefore to increase the fat content minimally fractionated soy that contains higher fat is used in the manufacturing of fibrous structures like meat analogues [In meat analogues, different flavour generation components and their critical interaction during processing have a crucial role in mimicking specific meat-like tastes and flavors. Meat analogue's taste and flavour predominate its acceptance as a meat alternative to the consumer. Uses of different spices, seasonings, herbs, sugars, salts, and savoury aromas, and their binding capacity to the plant proteins through the extrusion process are directly responsible for meat-like flavour generation [In the consumer's opinion, color is the most important parameter to create a visual appeal for meat analogues in their mind. Each meat has some specific color that changes through different processes such as cooking and smoking. Similarly, meat analogues should have meat mimic color and color change characteristics during processing. Several heat colorings agents such as malt or annatto, turmin, leghemoglobin, erythrosine, cumin, caramel colors, carotene, canthaxanthin, and lycopene have been used to incorporate the meat color and color change characteristics in the meat analogues [Meat analogues are made by combining a variety of ingredients through different texturizing techniques. For optimum binding of all the necessary ingredients (flavor, color, stabilizers, emulsifier, thickeners) several binding and texturing agents such as different natural gums (xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum), carrageenan, hydrocolloids (methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), wheat gluten, soy protein concentrate, casein are used [In meat analogues, water is a multi-functional ingredient, primarily from providing a hydration effect to the critical conformational change in protein water plays a crucial part in the designing of PBMA.

       "  'body': 'Finely chopped meat from various materials (such as hog, beef, mutton, etc.) is utilized in animal-based emulsion-type goods to create a steady blend, which links water and holds fat, offering the dish its distinctive texture when heated [Soy protein, gluten, pea proteins, and potato proteins are among the plant proteins that can hold water and stabilize emulsions and gels. There is also the option of including proteins in a texturized state to generate a rougher texture in formulations of the emulsion type. However, non-protein binders or fillers like polysaccharides are frequently added to proteins (e.g., fibres and starches). It is widely recognized that the occurrence of plant proteins frequently results in a decrease in gel formation/elasticity in cooked emulsion goods, which is where the inclusion of those components comes from [Fat is an important ingredient because it enhances the juiciness, softness, and as whole mouthfeel of emulsion-type products. Moisture and fat binding must be stable in the highly hydrated gel protein matrix. For meat products, rind emulsions or fat pre-emulsions are employed to stabilize the fat, avoiding fat departure while cooking and agglomerate of the fat on the product\\'s surface. Equivalent expectations are anticipated for plant-based contemporaries that employ plant oils and fats. For finely ground sausage applications such as\\xa0frankfurters, the kind of fat (meaning less or large melting temperature) appears to be less significant, but fats with greater melting points are employed for making cooked coarse-cutting sausages or emulsion-type products with fat additions such as\\xa0mortadella [To make the product mimic meat emulsion-type goods, colourants and spices are also included. Colors that are heat stable are employed, although they can also be naturalistic. For instance, to give plant-based bologna compositions (Smart Deli® Bologna by Lightlife) a traditional pink colour, paprika oleoresins and fermented rice flour were utilized. Depending on the kind of product the meat analogue imitates, a range of natural savoury spices and meaty scents are accessible [The goal of plant-based meat alternates that look like ground and bound meat from animals is to replicate its distinctive bite, chewiness, succulence, and firmness. Burgers, patties, and nuggets made from animal products mostly contain proteins and lipids with little amounts of seasoning, salt, and binders (for example, wheat crumbs, starches, and fibers). While binders help retain water and fat and enhance the texture and look of the product, salt alters the structure of proteins and toughens products (albeit in lesser quantities) [Frequently, low moisture extrusion heating is used to texturize the protein. The soy, wheat, or pea protein-based TVPs, as well as their combinations, are the most often utilized TVPs in meat analogues. However, there are more and more protein sources that can be texturized and may be employed in the creation of novel plant-based burger-like products. In the final product formulation, hydrated TVP adds the desired juiciness and gives the product a meaty, chewy texture. The capacity of novel protein sources to maintain water in the storage period and free it during cooking and distortion are the main topics of research. Nonetheless, just like ground beef, TVP cannot be used alone to create a cohesive product, necessitating the usage of binders.The major contenders in commercial products are egg protein and methylcellulose, although wheat gluten can also fill this character because it forms a network when wet and aids in binding TVP and other components. Texturizers that have a high water-holding capacity and can make the burger softer and juicier are used to further enhance the texture and mouthfeel of the items. Protein concentrates, protein isolates, and polysaccharides can all be employed to meet the latter ingredient needs. The product\\'s fat, which can be a free, emulsified, liquid or solid plant-based fat, affects the feeling of juiciness as well. To attain the ideal balance, liquid fats (like coconut or palm oil) and solid fats (like sunflower and canola oil) are frequently combined (for example, see the Beyond Burger® and the Impossible TM Burger). Ideal burger fats should be liquid when heated and solid at room temperature. As a result, the food has a satisfying mouthfeel like that of related meat products.Additionally, \"bleeding\" vegetarian burgers use beetroot juice to impart a recognizable meat hue while also attempting to impart a sense of juiciness. By creating new color-changing substances, flavourings, and fragrance precursors, research and development on plant-based burgers are also concentrated on obtaining even higher juiciness and enhancing the look and flavour of these goods.The imitation of whole-cut meats like chicken, pork, and beef steak, which are distinguished by the occurrence of long fibres or layered structures, is the goal of another category of meat analogue goods. Extrusion is used to create plant-based products that imitate this fibrous or layered structure. To obtain the desired final structure, colour, softness, aroma, and taste change, the items are treated more by freezing, curing, marinating, and cooking. Shear cell technology, which is currently being developed, has the prospective to produce big fragments of fibrous plant-based goods, whereas extrusion can currently only be used to produce small portions of similar products [Concentrates and other fewer refined formulas of soy protein, in addition to isolated soy protein, are employed in extrusion applications [Contingent on whether the result simulates raw or cooked meat, colouring agents and flavours (comprising salt) can either be incorporated in the structuring process or administered as a marinade later. Most applications for flavour addition rely on marination since flavour components are harmed by the conditions utilized in an extruder. According to a patent by Giezen et al. [The addition of ginger, papain, and their mixture to camel meat burger patties during formulation led to a considerable rise in the collagen solubility and sensory scores of juiciness, tenderness, overall acceptability, and a significant reduction of the shear force values.

       "  'body': \"Finely chopped meat from various materials (such as hog, beef, mutton, etc.) is utilized in animal-based emulsion-type goods to create a steady blend, which links water and holds fat, offering the dish its distinctive texture when heated [Soy protein, gluten, pea proteins, and potato proteins are among the plant proteins that can hold water and stabilize emulsions and gels. There is also the option of including proteins in a texturized state to generate a rougher texture in formulations of the emulsion type. However, non-protein binders or fillers like polysaccharides are frequently added to proteins (e.g., fibres and starches). It is widely recognized that the occurrence of plant proteins frequently results in a decrease in gel formation/elasticity in cooked emulsion goods, which is where the inclusion of those components comes from [Fat is an important ingredient because it enhances the juiciness, softness, and as whole mouthfeel of emulsion-type products. Moisture and fat binding must be stable in the highly hydrated gel protein matrix. For meat products, rind emulsions or fat pre-emulsions are employed to stabilize the fat, avoiding fat departure while cooking and agglomerate of the fat on the product's surface. Equivalent expectations are anticipated for plant-based contemporaries that employ plant oils and fats. For finely ground sausage applications such as\\xa0frankfurters, the kind of fat (meaning less or large melting temperature) appears to be less significant, but fats with greater melting points are employed for making cooked coarse-cutting sausages or emulsion-type products with fat additions such as\\xa0mortadella [To make the product mimic meat emulsion-type goods, colourants and spices are also included. Colors that are heat stable are employed, although they can also be naturalistic. For instance, to give plant-based bologna compositions (Smart Deli® Bologna by Lightlife) a traditional pink colour, paprika oleoresins and fermented rice flour were utilized. Depending on the kind of product the meat analogue imitates, a range of natural savoury spices and meaty scents are accessible [\"},\n",

       "  'body': 'The goal of plant-based meat alternates that look like ground and bound meat from animals is to replicate its distinctive bite, chewiness, succulence, and firmness. Burgers, patties, and nuggets made from animal products mostly contain proteins and lipids with little amounts of seasoning, salt, and binders (for example, wheat crumbs, starches, and fibers). While binders help retain water and fat and enhance the texture and look of the product, salt alters the structure of proteins and toughens products (albeit in lesser quantities) [Frequently, low moisture extrusion heating is used to texturize the protein. The soy, wheat, or pea protein-based TVPs, as well as their combinations, are the most often utilized TVPs in meat analogues. However, there are more and more protein sources that can be texturized and may be employed in the creation of novel plant-based burger-like products. In the final product formulation, hydrated TVP adds the desired juiciness and gives the product a meaty, chewy texture. The capacity of novel protein sources to maintain water in the storage period and free it during cooking and distortion are the main topics of research. Nonetheless, just like ground beef, TVP cannot be used alone to create a cohesive product, necessitating the usage of binders.The major contenders in commercial products are egg protein and methylcellulose, although wheat gluten can also fill this character because it forms a network when wet and aids in binding TVP and other components. Texturizers that have a high water-holding capacity and can make the burger softer and juicier are used to further enhance the texture and mouthfeel of the items. Protein concentrates, protein isolates, and polysaccharides can all be employed to meet the latter ingredient needs. The product\\'s fat, which can be a free, emulsified, liquid or solid plant-based fat, affects the feeling of juiciness as well. To attain the ideal balance, liquid fats (like coconut or palm oil) and solid fats (like sunflower and canola oil) are frequently combined (for example, see the Beyond Burger® and the Impossible TM Burger). Ideal burger fats should be liquid when heated and solid at room temperature. As a result, the food has a satisfying mouthfeel like that of related meat products.Additionally, \"bleeding\" vegetarian burgers use beetroot juice to impart a recognizable meat hue while also attempting to impart a sense of juiciness. By creating new color-changing substances, flavourings, and fragrance precursors, research and development on plant-based burgers are also concentrated on obtaining even higher juiciness and enhancing the look and flavour of these goods.'},\n",

Extrusion is used to create plant-based products that imitate this fibrous or layered structure. To obtain the desired final structure, colour, softness, aroma, and taste change, the items are treated more by freezing, curing, marinating, and cooking. Shear cell technology, which is currently being developed, has the prospective to produce big fragments of fibrous plant-based goods, whereas extrusion can currently only be used to produce small portions of similar products [Concentrates and other fewer refined formulas of soy protein, in addition to isolated soy protein, are employed in extrusion applications [Contingent on whether the result simulates raw or cooked meat, colouring agents and flavours (comprising salt) can either be incorporated in the structuring process or administered as a marinade later.

       "  'body': 'The subject of plant-based meat analogues has been the primary topic of conversation in the food area for quite some time because of expanded concern connected with the well-being influences and supportable advancement of meat choices. People may be more willing to substitute their meat consumption by creating meat analogues, which copy meat with both its nutritional content and its physical sensations. As a result, understanding the study findings on the creation, enhancement, requirement, sustainability, and usefulness of meat analogues is critical in developing a plan for future research in this sector. As a result, this review provides a thorough discussion of the importance of developing meat analogues, the health risks associated with producing meat products, the sources of plant proteins that can be used to develop meat analogues, the functionality of the ingredients used to develop these products, and consumer attitudes towards plant-based meat alternatives. The purpose is to assess the present status of scientific research on PBMA and estimate future research opportunities. Product development is difficult due to the wide range of ingredient functionality requirements across the many forms of plant-based meat substitutes (sausages, burgers, and meatballs). In general, meat analogue applications do not benefit from the functional properties of readily available protein-rich ingredients, the majority of which are highly purified from plant material. The need to use additives to improve product textures is critical. As a result, prospective research must be done to update the functioning of these novel food products and boost public knowledge of plant-based meat substitutes to increase consumer acceptance. Other fractionation techniques, which prioritize functionality over purity, can produce novel functionality. Additionally, novel proteins can provide novel ingredients for meat analog applications.'}]"

Generally, meat analogues are developed from defatted protein sources that result in lesser fat content in the meat analogues. Therefore to increase the fat content minimally fractionated soy that contains higher fat is used in the manufacturing of fibrous structures like meat analogues [In meat analogues, different flavour generation components and their critical interaction during processing have a crucial role in mimicking specific meat-like tastes and flavors. Meat analogue's taste and flavour predominate its acceptance as a meat alternative to the consumer. Uses of different spices, seasonings, herbs, sugars, salts, and savoury aromas, and their binding capacity to the plant proteins through the extrusion process are directly responsible for meat-like flavour generation [In the consumer's opinion, color is the most important parameter to create a visual appeal for meat analogues in their mind. Each meat has some specific color that changes through different processes such as cooking and smoking. Similarly, meat analogues should have meat mimic color and color change characteristics during processing. Several heat colorings agents such as malt or annatto, turmin, leghemoglobin, erythrosine, cumin, caramel colors, carotene, canthaxanthin, and lycopene have been used to incorporate the meat color and color change characteristics in the meat analogues [Meat analogues are made by combining a variety of ingredients through different texturizing techniques. For optimum binding of all the necessary ingredients (flavor, color, stabilizers, emulsifier, thickeners) several binding and texturing agents such as different natural gums (xanthan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum), carrageenan, hydrocolloids (methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), wheat gluten, soy protein concentrate, casein are used [In meat analogues, water is a multi-functional ingredient, primarily from providing a hydration effect to the critical conformational change in protein water plays a crucial part in the designing of PBMA.

       "   'body': 'Finely chopped meat from various materials (such as hog, beef, mutton, etc.) is utilized in animal-based emulsion-type goods to create a steady blend, which links water and holds fat, offering the dish its distinctive texture when heated [Soy protein, gluten, pea proteins, and potato proteins are among the plant proteins that can hold water and stabilize emulsions and gels. There is also the option of including proteins in a texturized state to generate a rougher texture in formulations of the emulsion type. However, non-protein binders or fillers like polysaccharides are frequently added to proteins (e.g., fibres and starches). It is widely recognized that the occurrence of plant proteins frequently results in a decrease in gel formation/elasticity in cooked emulsion goods, which is where the inclusion of those components comes from [Fat is an important ingredient because it enhances the juiciness, softness, and as whole mouthfeel of emulsion-type products. Moisture and fat binding must be stable in the highly hydrated gel protein matrix. For meat products, rind emulsions or fat pre-emulsions are employed to stabilize the fat, avoiding fat departure while cooking and agglomerate of the fat on the product\\'s surface. Equivalent expectations are anticipated for plant-based contemporaries that employ plant oils and fats. For finely ground sausage applications such as\\xa0frankfurters, the kind of fat (meaning less or large melting temperature) appears to be less significant, but fats with greater melting points are employed for making cooked coarse-cutting sausages or emulsion-type products with fat additions such as\\xa0mortadella [To make the product mimic meat emulsion-type goods, colourants and spices are also included. Colors that are heat stable are employed, although they can also be naturalistic. For instance, to give plant-based bologna compositions (Smart Deli® Bologna by Lightlife) a traditional pink colour, paprika oleoresins and fermented rice flour were utilized. Depending on the kind of product the meat analogue imitates, a range of natural savoury spices and meaty scents are accessible [The goal of plant-based meat alternates that look like ground and bound meat from animals is to replicate its distinctive bite, chewiness, succulence, and firmness. Burgers, patties, and nuggets made from animal products mostly contain proteins and lipids with little amounts of seasoning, salt, and binders (for example, wheat crumbs, starches, and fibers). While binders help retain water and fat and enhance the texture and look of the product, salt alters the structure of proteins and toughens products (albeit in lesser quantities) [Frequently, low moisture extrusion heating is used to texturize the protein. The soy, wheat, or pea protein-based TVPs, as well as their combinations, are the most often utilized TVPs in meat analogues. However, there are more and more protein sources that can be texturized and may be employed in the creation of novel plant-based burger-like products. In the final product formulation, hydrated TVP adds the desired juiciness and gives the product a meaty, chewy texture. The capacity of novel protein sources to maintain water in the storage period and free it during cooking and distortion are the main topics of research. Nonetheless, just like ground beef, TVP cannot be used alone to create a cohesive product, necessitating the usage of binders.The major contenders in commercial products are egg protein and methylcellulose, although wheat gluten can also fill this character because it forms a network when wet and aids in binding TVP and other components. Texturizers that have a high water-holding capacity and can make the burger softer and juicier are used to further enhance the texture and mouthfeel of the items. Protein concentrates, protein isolates, and polysaccharides can all be employed to meet the latter ingredient needs. The product\\'s fat, which can be a free, emulsified, liquid or solid plant-based fat, affects the feeling of juiciness as well. To attain the ideal balance, liquid fats (like coconut or palm oil) and solid fats (like sunflower and canola oil) are frequently combined (for example, see the Beyond Burger® and the Impossible TM Burger). Ideal burger fats should be liquid when heated and solid at room temperature. As a result, the food has a satisfying mouthfeel like that of related meat products.Additionally, \"bleeding\" vegetarian burgers use beetroot juice to impart a recognizable meat hue while also attempting to impart a sense of juiciness. By creating new color-changing substances, flavourings, and fragrance precursors, research and development on plant-based burgers are also concentrated on obtaining even higher juiciness and enhancing the look and flavour of these goods.The imitation of whole-cut meats like chicken, pork, and beef steak, which are distinguished by the occurrence of long fibres or layered structures, is the goal of another category of meat analogue goods. Extrusion is used to create plant-based products that imitate this fibrous or layered structure. To obtain the desired final structure, colour, softness, aroma, and taste change, the items are treated more by freezing, curing, marinating, and cooking. Shear cell technology, which is currently being developed, has the prospective to produce big fragments of fibrous plant-based goods, whereas extrusion can currently only be used to produce small portions of similar products [Concentrates and other fewer refined formulas of soy protein, in addition to isolated soy protein, are employed in extrusion applications [Contingent on whether the result simulates raw or cooked meat, colouring agents and flavours (comprising salt) can either be incorporated in the structuring process or administered as a marinade later. Most applications for flavour addition rely on marination since flavour components are harmed by the conditions utilized in an extruder. According to a patent by Giezen et al.

       "   'body': \"Finely chopped meat from various materials (such as hog, beef, mutton, etc.) is utilized in animal-based emulsion-type goods to create a steady blend, which links water and holds fat, offering the dish its distinctive texture when heated [Soy protein, gluten, pea proteins, and potato proteins are among the plant proteins that can hold water and stabilize emulsions and gels. There is also the option of including proteins in a texturized state to generate a rougher texture in formulations of the emulsion type. However, non-protein binders or fillers like polysaccharides are frequently added to proteins (e.g., fibres and starches). It is widely recognized that the occurrence of plant proteins frequently results in a decrease in gel formation/elasticity in cooked emulsion goods, which is where the inclusion of those components comes from [Fat is an important ingredient because it enhances the juiciness, softness, and as whole mouthfeel of emulsion-type products. Moisture and fat binding must be stable in the highly hydrated gel protein matrix. For meat products, rind emulsions or fat pre-emulsions are employed to stabilize the fat, avoiding fat departure while cooking and agglomerate of the fat on the product's surface. Equivalent expectations are anticipated for plant-based contemporaries that employ plant oils and fats. For finely ground sausage applications such as\\xa0frankfurters, the kind of fat (meaning less or large melting temperature) appears to be less significant, but fats with greater melting points are employed for making cooked coarse-cutting sausages or emulsion-type products with fat additions such as\\xa0mortadella [To make the product mimic meat emulsion-type goods, colourants and spices are also included. Colors that are heat stable are employed, although they can also be naturalistic. For instance, to give plant-based bologna compositions (Smart Deli® Bologna by Lightlife) a traditional pink colour, paprika oleoresins and fermented rice flour were utilized. Depending on the kind of product the meat analogue imitates, a range of natural savoury spices and meaty scents are accessible [\"},\n",

       "   'body': 'The goal of plant-based meat alternates that look like ground and bound meat from animals is to replicate its distinctive bite, chewiness, succulence, and firmness. Burgers, patties, and nuggets made from animal products mostly contain proteins and lipids with little amounts of seasoning, salt, and binders (for example, wheat crumbs, starches, and fibers). While binders help retain water and fat and enhance the texture and look of the product, salt alters the structure of proteins and toughens products (albeit in lesser quantities) [Frequently, low moisture extrusion heating is used to texturize the protein. The soy, wheat, or pea protein-based TVPs, as well as their combinations, are the most often utilized TVPs in meat analogues. However, there are more and more protein sources that can be texturized and may be employed in the creation of novel plant-based burger-like products. In the final product formulation, hydrated TVP adds the desired juiciness and gives the product a meaty, chewy texture. The capacity of novel protein sources to maintain water in the storage period and free it during cooking and distortion are the main topics of research. Nonetheless, just like ground beef, TVP cannot be used alone to create a cohesive product, necessitating the usage of binders.The major contenders in commercial products are egg protein and methylcellulose, although wheat gluten can also fill this character because it forms a network when wet and aids in binding TVP and other components. Texturizers that have a high water-holding capacity and can make the burger softer and juicier are used to further enhance the texture and mouthfeel of the items. Protein concentrates, protein isolates, and polysaccharides can all be employed to meet the latter ingredient needs. The product\\'s fat, which can be a free, emulsified, liquid or solid plant-based fat, affects the feeling of juiciness as well. To attain the ideal balance, liquid fats (like coconut or palm oil) and solid fats (like sunflower and canola oil) are frequently combined (for example, see the Beyond Burger® and the Impossible TM Burger). Ideal burger fats should be liquid when heated and solid at room temperature. As a result, the food has a satisfying mouthfeel like that of related meat products.Additionally, \"bleeding\" vegetarian burgers use beetroot juice to impart a recognizable meat hue while also attempting to impart a sense of juiciness. By creating new color-changing substances, flavourings, and fragrance precursors, research and development on plant-based burgers are also concentrated on obtaining even higher juiciness and enhancing the look and flavour of these goods.'},\n",

Extrusion is used to create plant-based products that imitate this fibrous or layered structure. To obtain the desired final structure, colour, softness, aroma, and taste change, the items are treated more by freezing, curing, marinating, and cooking. Shear cell technology, which is currently being developed, has the prospective to produce big fragments of fibrous plant-based goods, whereas extrusion can currently only be used to produce small portions of similar products [Concentrates and other fewer refined formulas of soy protein, in addition to isolated soy protein, are employed in extrusion applications [Contingent on whether the result simulates raw or cooked meat, colouring agents and flavours (comprising salt) can either be incorporated in the structuring process or administered as a marinade later.

The pH-shifting has also been applied to chemically modify proteins.

       "   'body': 'The subject of plant-based meat analogues has been the primary topic of conversation in the food area for quite some time because of expanded concern connected with the well-being influences and supportable advancement of meat choices. People may be more willing to substitute their meat consumption by creating meat analogues, which copy meat with both its nutritional content and its physical sensations. As a result, understanding the study findings on the creation, enhancement, requirement, sustainability, and usefulness of meat analogues is critical in developing a plan for future research in this sector. As a result, this review provides a thorough discussion of the importance of developing meat analogues, the health risks associated with producing meat products, the sources of plant proteins that can be used to develop meat analogues, the functionality of the ingredients used to develop these products, and consumer attitudes towards plant-based meat alternatives. The purpose is to assess the present status of scientific research on PBMA and estimate future research opportunities. Product development is difficult due to the wide range of ingredient functionality requirements across the many forms of plant-based meat substitutes (sausages, burgers, and meatballs). In general, meat analogue applications do not benefit from the functional properties of readily available protein-rich ingredients, the majority of which are highly purified from plant material. The need to use additives to improve product textures is critical. As a result, prospective research must be done to update the functioning of these novel food products and boost public knowledge of plant-based meat substitutes to increase consumer acceptance. Other fractionation techniques, which prioritize functionality over purity, can produce novel functionality. Additionally, novel proteins can provide novel ingredients for meat analog applications.'}]}"
