      "rays, extending up to the γ-ray energy range. The operation of undulators involves\n",
      "passing a relativistic electron beam through a spatially periodic magnetic structure,\n",
      "causing the electrons to undergo sinusoidal motion and emit radiation at specific\n",
      "wavelengths (See Fig.1).\n",
      "Inside the undulator, both photons and a strong magnetic field are present. This\n",
      "raises the question of whether the undulator itself could serve as an ALP factory.\n",
      "This question is particularly relevant to the so-called third-generation and later syn-\n",

      "In this paper, we carefully examine whether undulators can independently pro-\n",

      "field, electric current, and an ALP, both analytically and numerically. For light\n",

      "The phenomena we discuss here differs from the ‘axion bremsstrahlung’ discussed\n",
