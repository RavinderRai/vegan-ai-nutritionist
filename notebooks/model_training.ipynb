    "# Fine-Tuning with Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will fine-tune a smaller language model, Falcon-7B Instruct, by following a distillation process using synthetic data generated from a larger model. The purpose of distillation is to transfer the knowledge of the larger model to the smaller one, making it more efficient while retaining high-quality performance for a specific task: responding as a vegan nutritionist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "- **Generating Synthetic Data:** The larger model will act as a \"teacher\" by generating responses for a given set of prompts, simulating the role of a vegan nutritionist. These responses will form the synthetic dataset that the smaller model will learn from, covering a range of nutritional topics related to vegan diets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fine-Tuning the Smaller Model:** With the synthetic dataset prepared, we will fine-tune the smaller Falcon-7B Instruct model using the teacher model’s outputs as the target responses. This process enables the smaller model to learn from the larger model’s behavior, making it capable of producing relevant responses efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment Tracking:** Throughout the fine-tuning process, an experiment tracking system will be used to log hyperparameters, model performance, and training metrics. This will help in tracking progress and identifying the optimal model configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Next Steps:** Once the fine-tuning process is complete, we will proceed with building a separate inference pipeline and web application to handle real-time interactions. These components will be detailed in future steps of the project."

       "Rheumatoid arthritis is a debilitating inflammatory condition which has a high disease burden. While there is emerging evidence that certain foods and diets could have anti-inflammatory properties and there are published ‘anti-inflammatory’ diets, there is very little understanding of patient beliefs and perceptions about the impact of diet on symptom management or attitudes to particular dietary interventions. This scoping review aims to summarize the existing literature around the beliefs that patients with rheumatoid arthritis hold regarding the impact of diet on disease activity and joint pain. It also examines the current state of evidence regarding the impact of specific dietary interventions on patient reported and objective parameters of RA disease activity. A search was conducted across seven databases for studies which included reporting on dietary beliefs related to disease management or investigations on the effect of particular diets on disease activity or joint pain. Articles were excluded if they examined extracted compounds or individual dietary supplements. Included studies were synthesized narratively. We retrieved 25,585 papers from which 68 were included in this review: 7 assessed dietary beliefs, 61 explored dietary interventions. The available literature on patient beliefs has been largely limited to quantitative studies with limited qualitative exploration. The Mediterranean, fasting and vegan diets appear to have the most benefit with regards to rheumatoid arthritis outcomes for patients. Research which examines RA patient’s beliefs and attitudes about the impact of diet on their RA symptoms and disease is currently lacking."

       "The present study aimed to produce frozen dessert containing plant-based milk (almond, hazelnut, and lupine) and the probiotic Lb. acidophilus bacteria and to evaluate the chemical, microbiological and sensory properties during the 90 day-storage. Frozen dessert antioxidant capacity at day 0 and 90 of evaluation and changes in the phenolic compounds based on variations between different species were significant ( p  < 0.05). The differences in Lb. acidophilus counts between storage days were significant and values ranged from 4.15–8.99 log CFU/mL on the first day of storage to 3.61–7.06 at the end of the storage. Regarding the results of general acceptability in sensory evaluation, the highest color, taste and aroma scores was determined on day 0 in the hazelnut-lupine milk frozen dessert sample whereas the lowest was determined on day 30 in the almond-lupine milk frozen dessert sample. The samples with the highest antioxidant capacity were found on day 90 day in lupine frozen dessert (87.28 ± 0.007 mM) whereas the samples with the lowest antioxidant capacity were found on day 0 in the almond-hazelnut-lupine frozen dessert (18.83 ± 4.56 mM). Plant-based milk is considered suitable for the main ingredients in ice cream production, due to its health benefits its potential to be consumed as frozen dessert."

       "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex and common syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and various functional symptoms without clear structural or pathological causes. Affecting approximately 1–5% of the global population, with a higher prevalence in women, FM significantly impacts patients’ quality of life, often leading to considerable healthcare costs and loss of productivity. Despite its prevalence, the etiology of FM remains elusive, with genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, including nutrition, being implicated. Currently, no universally accepted treatment guidelines exist, and management strategies are often symptomatic. This narrative review explores the potential of a neuronutritional approach to FM management. It synthesizes existing research on the relationship between FM and nutrition, suggesting that dietary interventions could be a promising complementary treatment strategy. Various nutritional interventions, including vitamin D, magnesium, iron, and probiotics supplementation, have shown potential in reducing FM symptoms, such as chronic pain, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal issues. Additionally, weight loss has been associated with reduced inflammation and improved quality of life in FM patients. The review highlights the anti-inflammatory benefits of plant-based diets and the low-FODMAPs diet, which have shown promise in managing FM symptoms and related gastrointestinal disorders. Supplements such as vitamin D, magnesium, vitamin B12, coenzyme Q10, probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, S-adenosylmethionine, and acetyl- l -carnitine are discussed for their potential benefits in FM management through various mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory effects, modulation of neurotransmitters, and improvement of mitochondrial function. In conclusion, this review underscores the importance of considering neuronutrition as a holistic approach to FM treatment, advocating for further research and clinical trials to establish comprehensive dietary guidelines and to optimize management strategies for FM patients."

       "Purpose of Review International guidelines emphasize advice to incorporate dietary measures for the prevention and in the management of hypertension. Current data show that modest reductions in weight can have an impact on blood pressure. Reducing salt and marine oils have also shown consistent benefit in reducing blood pressure. Whether other dietary constituents, in particular the amount and type of fat that play important roles in cardiovascular prevention, influence blood pressure sufficiently to be included in the management of hypertension is less certain. In this review, we provide a summary of the most recent findings, with a focus on dietary patterns, fats and other nutrients and their impact on blood pressure and hypertension. Recent Findings Since reducing salt consumption is an established recommendation only corollary dietary advice is subject to the current review. Population studies that have included reliable evaluation of fat intake have indicated almost consistently blood pressure lowering with consumption of marine oils and fats. Results with vegetable oils are inconclusive. However dietary patterns that included total fat reduction and changes in the nature of vegetable fats/oils have suggested beneficial effects on blood pressure. Plant-based foods, dairy foods and yoghurt particularly, may also lower blood pressure irrespective of fat content. Summary Total fat consumption is not directly associated with blood pressure except when it is part of a weight loss diet. Consumption of marine oils has mostly shown moderate blood pressure lowering and possibly greatest effect with docosahexaenoic acid-rich oil."

       "Fossil fuel-based products should be replaced by products derived from modern biomass such as plant starch, in the context of the future circular economy. Starch production globally surpasses 50 million tons annually, predominantly sourced from maize, rice, and potatoes. Here, we review plant starch with an emphasis on structure and properties, extraction, modification, and green applications. Modification techniques comprise physical, enzymatic, and genetic methods. Applications include stabilization of food, replacement of meat, three-dimensional food printing, prebiotics, encapsulation, bioplastics, edible films, textiles, and wood adhesives. Starch from maize, potatoes, and cassava shows amylose content ranging from 20 to 30% in regular varieties to 70% in high-amylose varieties. Extraction by traditional wet milling achieves starch purity up to 99.5%, while enzymatic methods maintain higher structural integrity, which is crucial for pharmaceutical applications. Enzymatic extraction improves starch yield by of up to 20%, reduces energy consumption by about 30%, and lowers wastewater production by up to 50%, compared to conventional methods. Sustainable starch modification can reduce the carbon footprint of starch production by up to 40%. Modified starches contribute to approximately 70% of the food texturizers market. The market of starch in plant-based meat alternatives has grown by over 30% in the past five years. Similarly, the use of biodegradable starch-based plastics by the bioplastic industry is growing over 20% annually, driven by the demand for sustainable packaging.Kindly check and confirm the layout of Table 1.Layout is right"

      "Title: Freeze drying microencapsulation using whey protein, maltodextrin and corn powder improved survivability of probiotics during storage\n",
      "Abstract: Various studies demonstrated that probiotics play important roles in maintaining the balance of microorganisms in the body. Some strains produce bile salt hydrolase enzyme (BSH), which is an indirect mechanism for lowering cholesterol. BSH-producing probiotics as a supplement might be an alternative way to help reducing cholesterol in the body. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different microcapsule formulations with selected vegetable powders on growth characteristics of 3 Thai probiotic strains, Lactobacillus gasseri TM1, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus TM7, and L. rhamnosus TM14. Probiotics were cultured in MRS broth supplemented with 5 vegetable powders. Corn powder significantly increased growth rate of probiotics from 10^9 to 10^12 CFU/ml.

      "Abstract: Management of molasses-based wastewater generated in yeast and sugar industries is a major environmental concern due to its high chemical oxygen demand and other recalcitrant substances. Several strategies have been used to reduce the inland discharge of wastewater but the results are not satisfactory due to high operating cost. However, reuse of molasses-based wastewater irrigation in agriculture has been a major interest nowadays to reduce the freshwater consumption. Thus, it is crucial to monitor the impacts of molasses-based waste water irrigation on growth, metabolism, yield and nutritional quality of crops for safer consumer’s health. In present study, carrot seeds of a local cultivar (T-29) were germinated on filter paper in Petri dishes under controlled conditions. The germinated seeds were then transplanted into pots and irrigated with three different treatments normal water (T0), diluted molasses-based wastewater (T1), and untreated molasses-based wastewater (T2), in six replicates. Results revealed that carrot irrigated with untreated molasses-based waste water had exhibited significant reductions in growth, yield, physiology, metabolism, and nutritional contents. Additionally, accumulation of Cd and Pb contents in carrot roots irrigated with untreated molasses-based waste water exceed the permissible limits suggested by WHO and their consumption may cause health risks. While, diluted molasses-based waste water irrigation positively enhanced the growth, yield of carrot plants without affecting the nutritional quality. This strategy is cost effective, appeared as most appropriate alternative mean to reduce the freshwater consumption in water deficit regions of the world.\n",

      "Abstract: Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (Pi) are essential macronutrients that affect plant growth and development by influencing the molecular, metabolic, biochemical, and physiological responses at the local and whole levels in plants. N and Pi stresses suppress the physiological activities of plants, resulting in agricultural productivity losses and severely threatening food security. Accordingly, plants have elaborated diverse strategies to cope with N and Pi stresses through maintaining N and Pi homeostasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as potent regulators fine-tune N and Pi signaling transduction that are distinct and indivisible from each other. Specific signals, such as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), interact with miRNAs and add to the complexity of regulation. Elucidation of the mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate N and Pi signaling transduction aids in the breeding of plants with strong tolerance to N and Pi stresses and high N and Pi use efficiency by fine-tuning MIR genes or miRNAs. However, to date, there has been no detailed and systematic introduction and comparison of the functions of miRNAs in N and Pi signaling transduction from the perspective of miRNAs and their applications. Here, we summarized and discussed current advances in the involvement of miRNAs in N and Pi signaling transduction and highlighted that fine-tuning the MIR genes or miRNAs involved in maintaining N and Pi homeostasis might provide valuable sights for sustainable agriculture.\n",

For instance, in Arabidopsis, Pi starvation significantly increases the expression of miR778, miR827, and miR2111, and inhibits the expression of miR168, miR395, and miR398. Interestingly, the expression of miR778 and miR2111 quickly decrease by approximately two folds within three hours of the restored Pi supply (Paul et al. Fine-tuning\n",

This poses a significant risk to human and ecosystem health, and these issues are escalating rapidly [Vegetables accumulate toxic elements in edible and non-edible parts more easily as compared to fruits and cereal crops [ BSH activities were observed in The differences in BSH activities of LAB isolates might be due to the influences of disparate environments on expressions of BSH genes (Song et al., Different vegetable powders including cherry tomato, beetroot, pumpkin, bok choy, and corn at 5% (w/v) were added into culture media of The viability of probiotics Moreover, addition of vegetable powders reduced probiotic deaths and stabilized the growth rates of probiotics during the stationary phase (Fig.\\xa0This study was the first study which integrated corn powder into the mixture of microcapsule material. Several studies have reported prebiotic effects of corn compositions. Consumption of SCF for two weeks significantly enhanced bifidobacterial numbers in healthy volunteers (Costabile et al., Before freeze drying, there were approximately 10The survival of probiotic free cells and encapsulated of probiotics before–after freeze drying. WPI and MD have been wildly used as a mixture for microencapsulation because of their Maillard reaction’s property. Corn which is often used as a raw material in many food industries due to its low cost has never been used as encapsulate material. Structure of corn powder is composed of carbohydrates, soluble corn fiber and fibers which are suitable to be used as a wall material. Thus, incorporation of corn powder into the mixture of WPI-MD might strengthen encapsulated surface. It has been reported that chemically modified whey protein and cornstarch formulated into resistant starch (RS) used as an encapsulated material exhibited significantly greater microencapsulation property and protection against environmental microbial destruction than RS alone (Free cells and microencapsulated probiotics were observed under a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. The morphology of probiotics microencapsulated.

Results revealed that the effects of untreated molasses-based waste water exhibited significant reduction in growth, yield, physiology, metabolism, and nutritional contents of carrot. Additionally, Cd and Pb contents accumulation in carrot root of plants irrigated with untreated molasses-based waste water were found to exceed the permissible limits suggested by WHO and their consumption will cause health risks. While, diluted molasses-based waste water irrigation positively enhanced the growth, yield of carrot plants without affecting the nutritional quality. This strategy is cost effective, appeared as most appropriate alternative mean to reduce the freshwater consumption in water deficit regions of the world. This study suggest that policymakers should focus to develop guidelines for safe use of waste water irrigation and implement by raising awareness in farmers regarding risk associated with untreated waste water irrigation. The future research must be focused on developing strategies such as heavy metals remediation to avoid their accumulation in crops, and long term impact of diluted waste water irrigations on the soil health as well.',\n",

Water is often considered an abundant natural resource but only 3% of it is available for consumption with the remaining 97% trapped in the icecaps and snow covers [Waste water irrigation not only minimizes the pressure on freshwater resources, also provide a source of fresh water for local communities] [1].\n",

One of the most effective ways I found was to grow my own herbs and vegetables in a pot and then use the water from the pot to water my plants [2], [3] – [5] (see also [6] for more information on how to do this).\n",

Plant-based diets can be safe and nutritious for infants if properly planned. Make sure to include a variety of nutrient-dense plant foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds to ensure your baby is getting all the essential nutrients. \\n\\nBased on the context provided, it is important to note that carrots are a great source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. You can incorporate pureed or mashed carrots into your baby's diet to provide them with essential nutrients. Additionally, incorporating other plant foods like cherry tomatoes, beetroots, pumpkins, bok choy, and corn can add variety and additional nutrients to your baby's diet. \\n\\nWhen introducing solid foods to your baby, start with single-ingredient purees and gradually introduce new foods while closely monitoring for any allergies or intolerances. It's also important to consult with a pediatrician or a registered dietitian specializing in plant-based infant nutrition to ensure your baby is meeting their nutritional needs. \\n\\nOverall, with careful planning and consideration, a plant-based diet can provide your baby with all the necessary nutrients for healthy growth and development.\"}\n",
      "Testing Sample Data: {'about_me': 'I have a family history of heart disease and want to improve my heart health.', 'question': 'What plant-based diet is recommended for improving heart health?', 'context': 'This study presents the first extensive overview of sports nutritional supplement research through bibliometric and visual analyses and provides useful insights and analyses on future research directions. Research in the field of the NSSE can be divided into four stages: steady growth (2000–2007), exponential growth (2007–2013), fluctuation (2013–2017) and surge (2017–2024). The United States is the most active country in the field of nutritional supplements. European countries are the early batch of countries in this field, whose attention to research is not decreasing at the current stage, followed by South American and Southeast Asian countries as the emerging research mainstay countries. In recent years, Croatia, Colombia, Slovenia, Chile, Egypt, China, and Thailand have become the dominant countries in this field. The Australian Catholic University is the top research organization in the field. Burke LM from Australia had the most publications. Research in this area has been published in Nutrients in Switzerland. The study population mainly comprised men, and postmenopausal women were the main focus of the female group. Coronary heart and cardiovascular diseases continue to dominate research in this field. A milestone was achieved when the consensus statement was published in large numbers in 2022, signaling the agreement of experts in the field on common issues as well as some specific issues. Insulin resistance, sports nutrition, inflammation, alpha-linolenic acid, limb strength performance, female sex, and gut microbiota are the focus of the current stage of research and future studies. For all analyses performed in this work, we used full-bloom flowers (Fig.\\xa0Corolla and calyxes of the three The seeds of The function of miRNAs in maintaining N and Pi homeostasis can be explored by fine-tuning the Widely-used methods and technologies for accelerating plant breeding via fine-tuning Currently, the physiological and molecular verification and application of transgenic plants represents the most critical step for the implementation of basic research and the advancement of sustainable agriculture. Thus, we focus on discussing the technologies for fine-tuning miRNAs in transgenic research in the following (Fig.\\xa0Straightforward technologies of manipulating miRNA expression are the overexpression of Meanwhile, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR and CRISPR/Cas system modifying DNA sequences have revolutionized biotechnology and provided genetic tools for genetically modified plants (Manghwar et al. So far, there are limitations and opportunities in the application of CRISPR/Cas system in miRNA editing breeding. The knockout is mainly based on the canonical or discontinued SpCas9 that can induce Efficient', 'response': 'To improve heart health, I recommend following a plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. These foods are high in fiber, antioxidants, and essential nutrients that can help lower cholesterol levels, reduce inflammation, and support overall heart health. Include sources of omega-3 fatty acids such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts to further support heart health.\\n\\nBased on the information provided in the context, it is important to focus on cardiovascular diseases in the plant-based diet recommendation, as research in the field of nutritional supplements shows that these diseases continue to dominate. By following a plant-based diet, you can reduce the risk of heart disease and improve your heart health, as this type of diet has been shown to lower the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, the focus on inflammation in the research aligns with the anti-inflammatory properties of plant-based foods, further supporting the recommendation for a plant-based diet to improve heart health.'}\n"
